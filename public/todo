Regression Assumptions & Hypothesis Testing
1. List Assumptions
2. Illustrate non-linearity
3. Illustrate non-constant variance
4. Illustrate both

5. Go back to non-constant variance and work through ridge plots
6. Normal dist from OpenIntro
7. CIs from Open Intro





ANOVA
1. Just y-bar
2. Add segments of yi to ybar
3. Just y-hat
4. add segments for residuals
5. Add both lines
6. Add segments of total error
6. replace wth segments for both

7. Zoom in
8. Regression residuals
9. Residuals squared
10. SSE lines
11. SSE squared


Regression Standard Error (1.3)
