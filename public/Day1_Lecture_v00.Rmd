# (My) Goals for the course

## Get expertise as a statistical modeler

## Practice communicating your findings in the context of real-world problems

---
class: middle, inverse, center
# Why Model?

---
# Samples and Populations, Statistics and Parameters

- _Sample_: a (selected) sub-set of the population

- _Statistics_: numerical values calculated with sample data, estimates of the population parameters

---
# Types of Variables to Model

### Variable forms

- **Quantitative**: numbers where arithmetic makes sense (AKA continuous)

- **Categorical**: Groups/levels of a variable, each reflected by a different number

    - **Binary**: Categorical with just two groups
    
### Response and Explanatory Variables

- *Response:* AKA dependent variable, outcome variable

- *Explanatory:* AKA independent variable, predictor variable

    - Is it Quantitative, Categorical or Binary? 
    - What are it units?
    
- What's the explanatory variable? 
    - Is it Quantitative, Categorical or Binary?
    - What are it units?
    
- What would the regression equation be?

## How do you build a statistical model?

1. *Choose* the model: What type of model?
2. *Fit* the model to the data
3. *Assess* the model: Is the model adequate? Could it be simpler? Are assumptions met?
4. *Use*: Answer the question of interest

---
# 4 Step Process
- What model do you **choose**? 
    - What form are the data in (quantiative, categorical, etc.)?
    - If you can, write out the equation you want to fit and the null and alternative hypotheses.
- How do you **fit** this model? 
    - If you can recall, write out the `R` commands to fit the model you chose.
- What do you **assess** of the fitted model? 
    - What are the assumptions of the model you chose and how would you evaluate them? 
    - Are there other models that might work best?
- Can we **use** this model?
    - Given that the assumptions are met:
        - what are the results of this fitted this model? and 
        - to whom can we make inferences?
