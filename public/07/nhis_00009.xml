PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT. 

Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the section of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, 
race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 


Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.

A sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child, that is, the one person under 18 per family who was selected at random for additional health-related questions, beginning in 1997, for families that included children.

This variable is automatically included in all extracts, but only has valid values for 1997 forward.]]></txt>

(Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   

Every child in each family, except for active duty armed forces members and emancipated minors, was eligible to be selected as the sample child.  Emancipated minors are persons age 14 to 17 who are married or living with a partner OR who live on their own without the supervision of a parent, other adult family member, or legal guardian.  

CSTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample child" (code 4) for all children in the family in the following two cases: 1) if sample child status was incorrectly assigned to someone who was ineligible, or 2) if it was unknown which child in the family was chosen as sample child.   

A similar flag variable, ASTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample adult, that is, the one person age 18+ per family who was selected at random for additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.

This variable is automatically included in all extracts, but only has valid values for 1997 forward.]]></txt>

Such verbally reported data are less accurate than, and thus not fully comparable to, data on weight gleaned via direct measurement in other surveys, such as NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics).  Indeed, the Field Representative's Manual for 1991 specified that one rationale for collecting height and weight data in the NHIS was to compare respondents' answers to the distribution of actual body measurements obtained in the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, "to determine the reliability of self-reported or proxy-reported heights and weights."]]></txt>

Calculation of BMI

The Codebooks for 1997 forward provide information about the calculation of BMI by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and about the interpretation of the results.  

For 2004-2005, this information was phrased as follows:

BMI was calculated using the inhouse version of the height and weight variables, which contain the greater range of height and weight values than are available on the public use file.  BMI values shown [as the range of values reported in the codebook] are theoretical, not actual ranges.  BMI = [Weight(kg)/[Height(m) squared]], rounded to 2 decimal places.  Conversion factors: 1 kg = 2.205 pounds; 1 meter (m) = 39.37 inches.  For both men and women, underweight is BMI less than 18.5; healthy weight is BMI 18.5 to less than 25; overweight is BMI greater than or equal to 25; obesity is BMI greater than or equal to 30.


The wording in the Codebooks for 1997-2003 was slightly different, but the substantive meaning was the same as in the text quoted above.  

The conversion factors for 2006 forward were slightly different, with 1 kilogram defined as 2.20462 pounds and 1 meter defined as 39.37008 inches.
 

As the basis for BMI, the survey collected information about the individual's height and weight.  For height, interviewers asked, "How tall are you without shoes?"; for weight, interviewers asked, "How much do you weigh without shoes?"  These results are reported in HEIGHT and WEIGHT, respectively.

In the public use files, for 1997 forward, the heights and weights of people with unusually high or low values were suppressed, to protect respondents' confidentiality.   As mentioned in the quote above, to calculate BMI, the NCHS used the full range of weight and height values for respondents, not the restricted range of values included in the public use data files.]]></txt>
