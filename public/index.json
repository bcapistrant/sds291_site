Having two different kinds of projects seemed to confuse some, which I can understand but was not my intent. I didn’t want to call this an exam because just the word test or exam heightens peoples’ anxiety, mostly unnecessarily (or disproportionately). Numerically this is equivalent to ~2 homework/problem sets, so I would encourage you to think about this as just like a bigger problem set.\nOverall Instructions  The assignment is here. [note, this was last updated with clarifications on Wednesday at ~5:00pm ] There are three sections: A, B and C. A \u0026amp; B (mostly) cover the same thing and should be numbered accordingly (A1, B1, etc.). C is not graded, it just asks for your reflection. There is not an .rmd template. You can use one from a problem set or start a blank file. The file should be knitted to a .pdf. and submitted with your .rmd file on Moodle, just like a homework/problem set. Check your section’s moodle page for more details on where exactly to submit. To be safe, should include your code in the knitted output, which you can do with the following command in your first code chunk (it’s already there in the HW templates:  knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)  Be clear and organized about your output, and make it clear where you are getting your numbers/answers from. For example, if you have a summary output of a model under question X, and you answering question M with something that comes from the output you have in question X, just refer back to Question X in your answer. If you’re formatting equations with Markdown, see the resources section of the course site for some suggestions on key symbols and formatting. You can read in the data directly, as below:  data\u0026lt;-read.csv(\u0026quot;http://sds291.netlify.com/exam/291birthweight.csv\u0026quot;)  Guidelines for the Exam What you cannot do This exam is to be done completely independently: you may not talk to or work with anyone about the exam before the exam period closes (2/17/20 at 12:00pm Noon). All code and answers must be entirely your own.\nYou’re expected to abide by the college honor code about this exam. Any allegations or suspicion of violations of these policies or the honor code are taken extremely seriously and will be reported to the honor board.\nDon’t cheat. Please.\n What you can do You can ask me questions to clarify any logistical piece, phrasing of the questions, or other similar details about the exam. Please DM me on slack with questions and I will likely answer them for everyone so that everyone has the same information.\nI will also be having student hours on Wednesday (11-1pm). Note that these are a different time than usual student hours on Wednesday. I can address both clarifying questions for the exam and review concepts that we’ve covered so far in class, but I cannot speak to the exam content directly. For example, if you’re wondering about how to interpret the slope, bring examples from the book, from class, or previous problem sets.\nYou can ask Stat TAs about general concepts for the exam in a similar way.\nYou can use your book. In fact, I’d strongly encourage it.\nYou can use your class notes – labs, slides, notes you’ve taken, etc.\nYou can google for help if needed. You shouldn’t need any R code you haven’t already seen in class, and much of the advice on the internet is spotty in quality, so I would take it with a grain of salt. But you can use the internet.\n  Some general suggestions  Many of these concepts are subjective and may not have totally clear right or wrong answers. The safe bet is always to explain your rationale sufficiently. Most of the questions are pretty explicit about what you should be interpreting, but when in doubt, ask. Keep things organized, make it clear what your answer is (especially in a longer answer that can wander and make it hard to get your take away message), include everything (output, figures, etc.) you need for that particular answer (or refer clearly to where it is if you don’t want to reproduct it). Homework 2 will not be returned before this exam is due. There will not be an answer set distributed. If you have questions about homework 2, please come to office hours or clarify concepts with the Stat TAs.

The pdf doesn’t need to be made R - you can make it in Google Docs or Word, just saved as a pdf - especially for the draft, but here is an .RMD file for the Model Group Draft Proposal.\nContent of the Proposal Include the following:\nGroup Members / Name List the members of your group and your group name\n Title Proposed title of your project\n Purpose Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to study, as well some focused questions that you hope to answer and specific hypotheses that you intend to assess.\n Data Describe the data that you plan to use, with specifications of where it can be found (URL) and a short description. Which IPUMS surveys, in which years? Describe the source of the data - was it a survey, and if so, how were people selected and how was the data collected - in a few sentences. You can look to the IPUMS descriptions for details.\n Population Specify what the observational units are (i.e. the rows of the data frame), describe the larger population/phenomenon to which you’ll try to generalize, and (if appropriate) estimate roughly how many such individuals there are in the population.\n Response Variable What the response variable? What are its units? Estimate the range of possible values that it may take on. [Most projects will use a quantitative or a binary response variable (we will cover logistic regression for binary outcomes after Spring Break and in enough time that you can complete the project)].\n Explanatory Variables You should have one, primary explanatory variable that is your main hypothesis. You may have other explanatory variables associated with secondary hypotheses (no more than 2 secondary hypotheses, or three hypotheses total).\nThen you will also have explanatory variables that you want to control for – variables that may be associated with your primary explanatory and your response variables that you want to include in your multiple regression model to adjust your main association for those competing explanations. Demographics (age, sex, race) and socioeconomic status are common ones for individual-level survey data. Your final regression model must include at least 5 confounding variables beyond your main explanatory variable that is included in your hypothesis.\nCarefully define each variable and describe how each was measured (self-report/direct observation). For categorical variables, list the possible categories; for quantitative variables, specify the units of measurement.\n  Going from Draft into Final Proposal Once I respond to your initial proposal (within a week or so of submitting), you will revise it (perhaps starting with a different dataset), then submit a new proposal that addresses our feedback. Note that you may well need to start from scratch, so be thoughtful but open during the drafting process, and know that there will need to be revision.\nThe Final Proposal should include essentially the same information required as the initial proposal, but with more detail on the rationale for the study (i.e., why does this question matter? what is its relevance outside of this class?), revised hypotheses, and clearer proposed methods to test those hypotheses.

You may only work with IPUMS data, which sounds like a constraint, but is actually a great opportunity to work with relatively clean, well-documented data that could include any number of possible topics.\nWhat is IPUMS?\n IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. Data and services available free of charge.\n  IPUMS has created the world’s largest accessible database of census microdata. IPUMS includes almost a billion records from U.S. censuses from 1790 to the present and over a billion records from the international censuses of over 100 countries. We have also harmonized survey data with over 30,000 integrated variables and 150 million records, including the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, the Demographic and Health Surveys, and an expanding collection of labor force, health, and education surveys. In total, IPUMS currently disseminates integrated microdata describing 1.4 billion individuals drawn from over 750 censuses and surveys.\n Why are we using IPUMS for this class? The IPUMS user interface, data documentation, and having already “cleaned” much of the data will make your life substantially easier. Specifically, it will give you only the data you choose/need and remarkably better documented than many other sources of data you might find elsewhere. The benefit here is that you can focus instead on the actual task for this project - using your regression modeling skills you’re developing in the class - rather than wrangling unnecessary data. Given the breadth of the surveys / datasources included under the IPUMS umbrella, IPUMS should also serve a wide range of interests, especially economics, health, and social sciences. With 750 censuses/surveys, everyone in our class should be able to find a topic of interest from the IPUMS data. Last (but certainly not least), they have a R package called ipumsr (package here and vignettes here) to help import their data into R.\n IPUMS Data Sources \u0026amp; How they’re used in the News Some of the bigger surveys that IPUMS has worked to integrate over time get cited frequently in the press and used by other analysts, like Nathan Yau in his Flowing Data. Although most of these examples aren’t of regression modeling per se, they should give a sense of some of the flavor for what data each survey has and the kinds of questions you can answer with each of the surveys. For more academic applications of these data, you could also see IPUMS research award winners for some inspiration.\nCurrent Population Survey (CPS) IPUMS CPS harmonizes microdata from the monthly U.S. labor force survey, the Current Population Survey (CPS), covering the period 1962 to the present. Data include demographic information, rich employment data, program participation and supplemental data on topics such as fertility, tobacco use, volunteer activities, voter registration, computer and internet use, food security, and more.\n FiveThirtyEight  33 Million Americans Still Don’t Have Health Insurance College Freshmen Are More Politically Engaged Than They Have Been In Decades  NYTimessts  What the Tax Bill Would Look Life for 25,000 Middle Class Families and a [companion, process piece on how that was built] (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/insider/how-to-build-a-tax-calculator-thats-actually-useful.html) Whites have a huge wealth edge over blacks (but don’t know it)  Flowing Data  Constructed Career Paths from Job Switching Data Shifting Incomes for Young People    US Census \u0026amp; American Community Survey The American Community Survey is administered by the Census Bureau and includes information annually in between the decennial Census on ~1% of the US population.

This task will require you to write a project proposal, acquire and analyze relevant data, present your results orally to the class, and hand in a written report describing your study and its findings. Your project must involve fitting a regression model. The project is an opportunity to show off what you’ve learned about data analysis, visualization, and statistical inference. It is a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass.\n Groups You will work in a group of three, of your choosing. For project related questions via email / Slack, please use your group name and cc/tag your group mates as necessary.\n Assignment You should pose a problem that you find interesting and which may be addressed (at least in part) through the analysis of data. Many interesting quantitative questions (and perhaps even more uninteresting ones) involve the relationships among several variables. Recent projects have considered the following questions:\n What is gender pay gap in STEM workers?\n Is alcohol use associated with incidents of intimate partner violence?\n How is social support related to physical health and obesity?\n Does prevalence of intergenerational households vary by region of the country?\n How is income associated with total medical expenditures?\n Are there differences in skin cancer testing rates by education and race?\n How does the relationship between education and income vary by race/ethnicity?\n  You should pose the problem that you want to solve as precisely as possible at the outset. You should also make a hypothesis, a priori(before you analyze the data), about the results you expect to see. You may not propose a question without a succinct main hypothesis of one explanatory variable and one response variable; you may have up to 2 secondary hypotheses that you also explore.\nWe will be using data from IPUMS (see link below to a description of IPUMS for this project)\nYou might consider examples from previous Undergraduate Statistics Class Project winners to get a sense of the scope and presentation of a high quality project.\n General Rules You may discuss your project with other students, but each group will have a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help each other. You may consult other sources for information about the non-statistical, substantive issues in your problem, but you should credit these sources in your report. Feel free to consult with us about statistical questions. To foreshadow the presentation: note that everyone is expected to speak during the presentation.\n Timeline Please see the syllabus for due dates.\n Submission All deliverables described above must be delivered electronically via Moodle by 11:55pm (five minutes before midnight) on the dates above. Only one person from the group should submit the group’s product for each checkpoint (with the exception of the Group Dynamic, which is individual).\n Proposals (draft and final) Count on brainstorming at least half a dozen serious ideas before you can groom one of them into a mature proposal.\nFor the most part, the choice of topic is left up to you. Try to pick something that’s interesting yet substantial and worth studying, and aim for a topic that you think nobody has tried before; remember that part of your overall grade will be based on originality.\n IPUMS Data Finding the right data to answer your particular question is part of your responsibility for this assignment. You may also want to refine your research question so that it can be more clearly addressed by the data that you found. But be creative!\nIn order to help you narrow your choice and focus on appropriate data sets, as well as to maximize my ability to help you, projects can (and must) use data any of the IPUMS data, which are listed below and highlighted in more detail in the HTML file attached at the bottom:\nIPUMS has many census, national and international survey datasets that are well-documented and cleaned.\nHealth  National Health Interview Survey (health status, trends) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (health care, health care spending)   Economics  Current Population Survey Census \u0026amp; American Community Survey Data   Non-US populations  Demographic and Health Surveys (low- and middle-income countries) International Census Data   STEM \u0026amp; Higher Education  Time-Use Most projects will measure a quantitative or a binary response variable (we will cover logistic regression for binary outcomes after Spring Break and in enough time that you can complete the project).\nOnce I respond to your initial proposal, you will revise it (perhaps starting with a different dataset), then submit a new proposal that addresses our feedback. Supply essentially the same information required for the initial proposal, but give a bit more detail on the rationale for the study (i.e., why does this question matter? what is its relevance outside of this class?), revised hypotheses, and clearer proposed methods to test those hypotheses.\n  Content Your initial and revised proposals should contain the following content:\nGroup Members: List the members of your group\nTitle: Your title\nPurpose: Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to study, as well some focused questions that you hope to answer and specific hypotheses that you intend to assess.\nData: Describe the data that you plan to use, with specifications of where it can be found (URL) and a short description. Which IPUMS surveys, in which years? Describe the source of the data - was it a survey, and if so, how were people selected and how was the data collected - in a few sentences. You can look to the IPUMS descriptions for details.\nPopulation: Specify what the observational units are (i.e. the rows of the data frame), describe the larger population/phenomenon to which you’ll try to generalize, and (if appropriate) estimate roughly how many such individuals there are in the population.\nResponse Variable: What the response variable? What are its units? Estimate the range of possible values that it may take on.\nExplanatory Variables: You should have one, primary explanatory variable that is your main hypothesis. You may have other explanatory variables associated with secondary hypotheses (again, no more than 2). Then you will also have explanatory variables that you want to control for – factors that may be associated with your primary explanatory and your response variables that you want to include in your multiple regression model to adjust your main association for those competing explanations. Demographics (age, sex, race) and socioeconomic status are common ones for individual-level survey data. Carefully define each variable and describe how each was measured (self-report/direct observation). For categorical variables, list the possible categories; for quantitative variables, specify the units of measurement. You may want to add more variables later on, but you should have at least the explanatory variables associated with your hypotheses and 5 additional variables you plan to control for already.\n Final Products: Report and Presentation Report The report itself should be a 3-page paper reporting the results of your project that includes the following:\nIntroduction: Background/significance of the research, and a clearly stated research question an hypothesis/hypotheses. (What you’re doing and why) In a few paragraphs (1-3), you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question is, why it is interesting, and what contribution you have made towards answering that question. You should give an overview of the specifics of your model, but not the full details. Most readers never make it past the introduction, so this is your chance to hook the reader, and is in many ways the most important part of the paper! You should have at least 1-3 citations to previous research in this area to support your ideas and show what has already been done and what gap you are filling.\nMethods: The methods used to obtain and analyze the data (How you’re doing it) This should include a brief description of your data set. Some questions you should consider (though this is not an exhaustive list): What is the population that was sampled? How was the sample collected? What variables are included in your analysis? Where did they come from? What are units of measurement? How much missing data did you have and what did you do about it? How did you choose which variables to include in your model? What kind of model did you fit? How did you evaluate the assumptions of this model? Don’t tell us the results, just tell us the steps you took. Think of this is as like in a lab report that is reproducible – someone else should be able to download the same data, follow your steps, and get the same results.\nResults: The results of the analysis - both descriptive text and tables, charts, or graphs (What you found) This section is an explanation of what your model tells us about the research question. You should interpret coefficients in context and explain their relevance. What does your model tell us about your research question and hypothesis? You may want to include negative results, but be careful about how you interpret them. For example, you may want to say something along the lines of: “we found no evidence that explanatory variable xxis associated with response variable yy,” or “explanatory variable xx did not provide any additional explanatory power above what was already conveyed by explanatory variable zz.” On other hand, you probably shouldn’t claim: “there is no relationship between xx and yy,” which is akin to accepting the null.\nDiscussion: A discussion of the research, the limitations of the current research, reasonableness of any assumptions made, possibilities of future work/studies that should be conducted, etc. (How your findings help answer your question, why your findings matter (or don’t!))\nA summary of your findings and a discussion of their limitations. First, remind the reader of the question that you originally set out to answer, and summarize your findings. Second, discuss the limitations of your model, and what could be done to improve it. You might also want to do the same for your data. Also include a few sentences about the strength(s) of your analysis / study. This is your last opportunity to clarify the scope of your findings before a journalist misinterprets them and makes wild extrapolations! Protect yourself by being clear about what is not implied by your research.\nThe entire written summary must be no more than 3 pages (single spaced, Arial 11pt font with standard 1 inch margins).\nIn addition to the 3 pages with the main content you should have a title page which includes: - The title of the project and - a one-paragraph abstract (summary) of the entire project (\u0026lt;150 words)\nThe abstract should not consist of more than 5 or 6 sentences, but should relate what you studied and what you found. It need only convey a general sense of what you actually did. The purpose of the abstract is to give a prospective reader enough information to decide if they want to read the full paper.\nReferences should be listed at the end of the report and do not count against the 3 page limit.\nExample: You might submit a 4.5 page Word document that is consists of the title page, 3 pages of text/graphs and half page of references.\n(Optional) You may include up to 5 additional pages of information about your project in an appendix (as part of the single uploaded file),this could include secondary analysis results that didn’t fit, figures to check your model assumptions, descriptive statistics / figures, extra charts/tables, etc. The optional appendix may be reviewed, but you should not plan on it. Your material in the 3 page report should be self-contained; no information deemed critical to the evaluation of your project should be included in the Appendix.\nYour report should be submitted via email as an R Markdown (.Rmd) file and the corresponding rendered output (.pdf) file.\n  Content You should not need to present all of the R code that you wrote throughout the process of working on this project. Rather, the technical report should contain the minimal set of R code that is necessary to understand your results and findings in full. If you make a claim, it must be justified by explicit calculation. A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to compile your .Rmd file without modification, and verify every statement that you have made. All of the R code necessary to produce your figures and tables must appear in the technical report. In short, the technical report should enable a reviewer to reproduce your work in full.\nThe technical report is not simply a dump of all the R code you wrote during this project. Rather, it is a narrative, with technical details, that describes how you addressed your research question. You should not present tables or figures without a written explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure.\nKeep in mind the distinction between data and information. Data is just numbers, whereas information is the result of analyzing that data and digesting it into meaningful ideas that human beings can understand. Your technical report should allow a reviewer to follow your steps from converting data into information. For example, simply displaying a table with the means and standard deviations of your variables is not meaningful. Writing a sentence that reiterates the content of the table (e.g. “the mean of variable xx was 34.5 and the standard deviation was 2.8…”) is equally meaningless. What you should strive to do is interpret these values in context (e.g. “although variables x1 and x2 have similar means, the spread of x1 is much larger, suggesting…”). Think of the text in the result section as a way to walk the reader through your tables / figures and to convey results that are important but not included in a table.\nYou should present figures and tables in your technical report in context. These items should be understandable on their own – in the sense that they have understandable titles, axis labels, legends, and captions. Someone glancing through your technical report should be able to make sense of your figures and tables without having to read the entire report. That said, you should also include a discussion of what you want the reader to learn from your figures and tables. Use the stargazer package and consider plotting your results in a figure.\n Tone This document should be written for peer reviewers, who comprehend statistics at least as well as you do. You should aim for a level of complexity that is more statistically sophisticated than an article in the Science section of The New York Times, but less sophisticated than an academic journal. [Chance magazine might provide a good example.] For example, you may use terms that that you will likely never see in the Times(e.g. bootstrap), but should not dwell on technical points with no obvious ramifications for the reader (e.g. reporting F-statistics). Your goal for this paper is to convince a statistically-minded reader (e.g. a student in this class, or a student from another school who has taken an introductory statistics class) that you have addressed an interesting research question in a meaningful way. Even a reader with no background in statistics should be able to read your paper and get the gist of it.\n ","date":1581033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581033600,"objectID":"c4c947b8d45184324fc8e3cda2ff446a","permalink":"/group/00-group/","publishdate":"2020-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group/00-group/","section":"group","summary":"Project related material Groups Assignment General Rules Timeline Submission Proposals (draft and final) IPUMS Data Health Economics Non-US populations STEM \u0026amp; Higher Education Time-Use  Content Final Products: Report and Presentation Report  Content Tone   Project related material As a major component of this class, you (and your group) will conduct a statistical study on a topic of your choice.

Feeling rusty on your introductory statistics material?*\nDon’t fret – we’ll do this all together, no need to feel like you have to do any prep before class.

You might want to review normal distributions, tests of differences in means (t-tests), ANOVA, and interpretation of p-values and confidence intervals. We’ll cover the regression specific material, but those ideas underlie much of regression. Again, I wouldn’t stress about this at this point, but a very quick skim could help get the dust off your recall of this material.  *Many former students have had some anxiety coming into the class about the learning curve to learn R. I am fully anticipating – and can empathize with! – this nervousness. We will talk plenty about how to get going with R for those in the class who haven’t used it before, with additional resources as we get going.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. R is the language and what’s running “under the hood”, and RStudio is essentially a really user-friendly way to do what you want in R.\nThere are a few different ways to work with R and RStudio. For new users, I would recommend using the server. For anyone who has used R before, you can use the server or the desktop version.\nSmith College RStudio Server R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. Smith College runs it’s own version of RStudio that’s accessable through your web browser and won’t require installing anything. The Smith College RStudio Server is here, and you all should have accounts set up already. This is a great option for class – I strongly recommend anyone new to R and RStudio use this option. It requires a bit of uploading and downloading to get documents on and off the server (just like uploading and downloading from Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), but otherwise is all set up with everything you need.\n RStudio.cloud Similar to the college server, RStudio.cloud is a cloud-based application of RStudio that run by RStudio, not by the College and its IT tesm. There will still be up/downloading like with the server, but the main advantage of this approach is that we can all share the same documents in a class “workspace”, which makes getting stared even a little easier. Part of the “Getting Started” assignment was to make an account – again, easiest if connected to your Smith Google account – and I will provide a link to a shared class workspace before we start using RStudio.cloud.\n RStudio locally on your computer The server and cloud approaches are great for probably 80% of what we’ll do in the class. For the other 20% – probably the group project work – these can be slower. If you want to work on RStudio locally on your computer, you certainly can. For anyone planning to take another SDS course, this might be a good approach at some point in the semester.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/ Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-3.5.1.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 3.6.1) and download it.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download Select the installer that corresponds with your computer’s operating system (Windows or macOS):\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse2 for instance, consists of dozens of packages that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n Install Stat2Data The textbook for this course also has a package available with all of the datasets for the problems in the back of the book that we’ll be using for homework. You can repeat the steps above for Stat2Data instead of tidyverse or type the command directly into the console: install.packages(\u0026quot;Stat2Data\u0026quot;).\nNote of thanks and attributions: This page was developed based on previously developed materials, especially Andrew Heiss, and is used here with appreciation and due attirbution.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩\n A universe of packages centered around tidy data, including ggplot2↩\n   ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"86f1654d0114d88986a69932d4d656ee","permalink":"/resources/install/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/install/","section":"resources","summary":"Smith College RStudio Server RStudio.cloud RStudio locally on your computer Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse Install Stat2Data    We will do all of the modeling (and other computational work) in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

The pdf doesn’t need to be made R - you can make it in Google Docs or Word, just saved as a pdf - especially for the draft, but here is an .RMD file for the Model Group Draft Proposal.\nContent of the Proposal Include the following:\nGroup Members / Name List the members of your group and your group name\n Title Proposed title of your project\n Purpose Describe the general topic/phenomenon you want to study, as well some focused questions that you hope to answer and specific hypotheses that you intend to assess.\n Data Describe the data that you plan to use, with specifications of where it can be found (URL) and a short description. Which IPUMS surveys, in which years? Describe the source of the data - was it a survey, and if so, how were people selected and how was the data collected - in a few sentences. You can look to the IPUMS descriptions for details.\n Population Specify what the observational units are (i.e. the rows of the data frame), describe the larger population/phenomenon to which you’ll try to generalize, and (if appropriate) estimate roughly how many such individuals there are in the population.\n Response Variable What the response variable? What are its units? Estimate the range of possible values that it may take on. [Most projects will use a quantitative or a binary response variable (we will cover logistic regression for binary outcomes after Spring Break and in enough time that you can complete the project)].\n Explanatory Variables You should have one, primary explanatory variable that is your main hypothesis. You may have other explanatory variables associated with secondary hypotheses (no more than 2 secondary hypotheses, or three hypotheses total).\nThen you will also have explanatory variables that you want to control for – variables that may be associated with your primary explanatory and your response variables that you want to include in your multiple regression model to adjust your main association for those competing explanations. Demographics (age, sex, race) and socioeconomic status are common ones for individual-level survey data. Your final regression model must include at least 5 confounding variables beyond your main explanatory variable that is included in your hypothesis.\nCarefully define each variable and describe how each was measured (self-report/direct observation). For categorical variables, list the possible categories; for quantitative variables, specify the units of measurement.\n  Going from Draft into Final Proposal Once I respond to your initial proposal (within a week or so of submitting), you will revise it (perhaps starting with a different dataset), then submit a new proposal that addresses our feedback. Note that you may well need to start from scratch, so be thoughtful but open during the drafting process, and know that there will need to be revision.\nYou may also want to summarize what’s different from your Draft to your Final proposal to illustrate the work you did in the revision.\nThe Final Proposal should include essentially the same information required as the initial proposal, but with more detail on the rationale for the study (i.e., why does this question matter? what is its relevance outside of this class?), revised hypotheses, and clearer proposed methods to test those hypotheses. See the Model Group Draft Proposal for an example of a fully fleshed out, comprehensive example of a final proposal.\n ","date":1582848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582848000,"objectID":"699a92ba0ccd442dbc8202d63b68e7b7","permalink":"/group/02-group-finalproposal/","publishdate":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group/02-group-finalproposal/","section":"group","summary":"Content of the Proposal Group Members / Name Title Purpose Data Population Response Variable Explanatory Variables  Going from Draft into Final Proposal   Submit this as a pdf to moodle.

There is some evidence that sexual minorities with history of cancer may have worse quality of life than heterosexual counterparts. This difference may be pronounced for those with sex-specific cancers, where the interactions with providers or the changes to one’s sexual/gender identity matter differently for sexual minorities. There may also be differences within sexual minorities by race, as per intersectionality theory. This project will test that association in a large, nationally-representative sample.\nThe primary hypothesis is that, among those with history of cancer, sexual minorities will have lower quality of life than heterosexual counterparts.\nThe secondary hypotheses are:\nThe difference in quality of life between sexual minorities and heterosexual cancer survivors will be larger for sex-specific cancers (e.g., breast or prostate) than other cancers.\n Sexual minorities of color will have worse outcomes than white sexual minorities.\n   Data This study will use data from IPUMS-NHIS. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) annually surveys the US non-institutionalized population about their health, health care, and health conditions. NHIS first asked questions about sexual orientation in 2013. Because sexual minority populations with cancer will be relatively rare, we will pool data from 2013-2016 to maximize the sample size and increase statistical power.\n Population NHIS includes individual survey respondents such that each observation is a different person.\nNHIS is an annual, cross-sectional household survey. Individuals are clustered in households, particularly that one adult and one random child are included from each household. Since we are only interested in adults, each observation should be independent of the others as none of them will be co-residents in the same household. Moreover, although we are pooling data from multiple years, since the survey is cross-sectional, the independence assumption is not violated with repeated measures on the same person.\nAs this topicis specific to those with a history of cancer, we will filter the data to include only those with history of cancer using the variable CANCEREV. Thus, the population of inference will be the US adult population with cancer.\n Response Variable The response variable will be a measure of self-rated health: “Would you say your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?”. The variable is called HEALTH in IPUMS-NHIS.\nThe response options are: 1=Excellent; 2=Very good; 3=Good; 4=Fair; 5=Poor; 7=Refused; 9=Don’t know.\nWe will create a new, two-level variable from these responses that indicates good health: Excellent/Very good vs. Good/Fair/Poor.\nWe will use logistic regression to model this outcome.\n Explanatory Variables Primary hypothesis As stated above in “Population”, we will restrict this analysis to those who have cancer.\nThe primary hypotheses will use a variable indicating sexual orientation . We will create this variable from two different sources.\nIndividuals self-report their sexual orientation (SEXORIEN in NHIS) in response to a question: “Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?”\nAnswer options: 1=Gay; 2=Straight, that is, not gay; 3=Bisexual; 4=Something else; 5=I don’t know the answer; 7=Refused.\nWe will combine responses and create a variable that indicates being either gay/bisexual vs. straight/something else/don’t know.\nThe test of our hypothesis will be\n\\(H_0: \\beta1=0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta1\\neq0\\)\nfrom the regression model: \\[logit(GoodHealth) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 SexualMinority +\\beta\u0026#39;X\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta\u0026#39;X\\) is a vector of covariates included to control for potential confounding. They are described below.\n Secondary hypotheses 1. The difference in quality of life between sexual minorities and heterosexual cancer survivors will be larger for sex-specific cancers (e.g., breast or prostate) than other cancers.\nWe will create an indicator variable of those with breast, ovarian, cervical, uterine, testicular or prostate cancer vs. other kinds of cancer. NHIS asks questions about cancer type at every year between 2013-2016, detailed here.\nWe will test this hypothesis with an interaction between sexual orientation and sex-specific cancer type.\nThe test of our hypothesis will be\n\\(H_0: \\beta3=0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta3\\neq0\\)\n\\[ \\begin{split} logit(GoodHealth) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 SexualMinority + \\beta_2 SexSpecificCancers + \\\\ \\beta_3 (SexualMinority \\times SexSpecificCancers) +\\beta\u0026#39;X \\end{split} \\]\n2. Sexual minorities of color will have worse outcomes than white sexual minorities.\nThis information comes from a question about the respondent’s race: “What race or races do you consider yourself to be? Please select 1 or more of these categories.” IPUMS included 5 categories: White, Black/African American, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Multiple Race in the RACENEW variable.\nWe will try to test each racial group separately, but we may have to collapse into an indicator/binary variable of white vs. non-white race.\n\\(H_0: \\beta3=0\\)\n\\(H_A: \\beta3\\neq0\\)\n\\[ \\begin{split} logit(GoodHealth) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 SexualMinority + \\beta_2 NonWhiteRace + \\\\ \\beta_3 (SexualMinority \\times NonWhiteRace) +\\beta\u0026#39;X \\end{split} \\]\nThis analysis will be restricted to only sexual minorities.\nPotential Confounders We suspect that demographic and socio-economic factors will be important to control for, as they would be associated with both sexual orientation and with health.\nAge AGE Sex SEX Marital Status MARSTCOHAB Race RACENEW Hispanic Ethnicity HISPYN Education EDUC  We might want to control for other health characteristics like smoking, physical activity, diet, and mental health. We will explore that in our analysis after we review the literature to find what is most commonly done.\n   ","date":1582848000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582848000,"objectID":"7ec4b5ec4c47a18cf7c39ad5b4385ca5","permalink":"/group/02-modelfinalgroupproposal/","publishdate":"2020-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/group/02-modelfinalgroupproposal/","section":"group","summary":"Template for This File Group Name and Members Title Purpose and Hypotheses Data Population Response Variable Explanatory Variables Primary hypothesis Secondary hypotheses    Template for This File Here is the raw .RMD file that generated this page.\n Group Name and Members “Model” Group\nMembers:\n Prof. Capistrant Tyra Banks Jenny Shimizu   Title Quality of Life among Sexual Minority Cancer Survivors\n Purpose and Hypotheses This project focuses on the self-reported quality of life and general health of sexual minorities (i.","tags":null,"title":"Model Group Final Proposal","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Required Template .RMd file Submit on Moodle   Required Questions 2.15, 2.18, and 2.25 (2nd Edition) or 2.13, 2.16, and 2.17 (1st Edition)\nSkip 2.25 / 2.17 A\nFor 2.25 / 2.17 D, refer to 2.18 / 2.16 A instead of 2.25 / 2.17 A\n Template .RMd file There is a template RMarkdown file for these questions here.

Upper Right: your environment Bottom Right: a bunch of very helpful tabs Bottom Left / Left panel:  Upper Left: RMarkdown files appear here once opened.   Intro to R, RStudio, RMarkdown What is R, RStudio and RMarkdown?  R: is a programming language specifically designed for statistical analysis. R is open-source, and is developed by a team of statisticians and programmers in both academia and industry. It is updated frequently and has become the de facto industry standard. In the data science realm, alternatives to R include Python with the Pandas library, and Julia. In the statistics realm, alternatives include SAS, Stata, and SPSS.\n RStudio: is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. RStudio is also open-source software, and depends upon a valid R installation to function. RStudio as available as both a both Desktop and Server application. You can think of RStudio as the piece of software through which you can run commands, do data cleaning statistical tests, and run more complicated programs that you write in R code. RStudio also has functionality to combine the statistical processes with text, figures, etc. with RMarkdown (below).\n RMarkdown: is a syntax for composing relatively simple documents that combine R code and text. R Markdown is an extension of markdown (a general-purpose authoring format) that provides functionality for processing R code and output. If you’ve used Stata or SPSS before, think about RMarkdown some combination of your statistical program / do file and the text features of Word where you would write up your results. Rather than doing them separately, cutting and pasting results into Word, you can do it all in the same file with RMarkdown. With RMarkdown, you can do both R code and include written text both in the same file, “knit” it (i.e., combine the pieces of the file together) into output formats like pdf, Word document, and HTML. Your homeworks will be completed in RMarkdown (.rmd files) and knit into a .pdf format.\n    The RStudio interface (i.e., what am I looking at on the screen and what do I do?) In clockwise order, let’s talk through what’s going on in each of the quadrants of the screen\nUpper Right: your environment  This quadrant includes datasets, created variables, etc, and history shows all of the commands that you’ve previously entered.   Bottom Right: a bunch of very helpful tabs  Files: anything you’ve uploaded to the server (datasets, markdown files) and the resulting files that you knitted together will be here Plots: any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner. Help: you can search here for help, to find commands, etc. Packages: the list of installed packages, such as packages to tell R how to make a graph, to fit a linear regression model. The textbook has a package that includes all of the datasets used in the examples – you can look to see if Stat2Data is listed Viewer: where output gets generated, including knitted files   Bottom Left / Left panel: Initially, when you open RStudio, all that’s on the left is the Console. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running. Below that information is the prompt. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. To work interactively (i.e., you type a command right after the \u0026gt;, press enter, and see the results), you can use the prompt.\n  Upper Left: RMarkdown files appear here once opened. We will be using RMarkdown, where you can write sections of code and text interspersed with one another in one RMarkdown file (.rmd). You can tell RStudio to run code in an RMarkdown file line-by-line, chunk-by-chunk (chunk is the highly technical R term for a section of code), or to “knit” the text and the results of the executed code in the RMarkdown file into one complete finished product. When you open RMarkdown files, they appear in the top left quadrant of the screen (in orange below), and the console moves down.\nSee an example below:\nNote of thanks and attributions: This page was developed based on previously developed materials, particularly from Amelia McNamara and Andrew Heiss.\n ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"e3670293d7c58dc1814099af8e5cf93b","permalink":"/resources/interface/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/interface/","section":"resources","summary":"Intro to R, RStudio, RMarkdown What is R, RStudio and RMarkdown?

Upload the file(s) to Moodle for the HW assignment of interest. You’re done! If you are using RStudio locally (i.e., on your computer)    Steps for Homework If you are new to R and RStudio, there’s another page in this section that provides a little more background on what R is, the terminology of R, and an introduction to the user interface of RStudio. Please (re-) read that before getting into the specific steps of how to use RStudio to complete your homework (which is below).\nThese instructions below are specific to using the RStudio Server, which you are encouraged to use. If you’re running RStudio locally on your desktop, you will have a different interface and process (see note below about additional software you need if running RStudio locally on your computer).\nSign into RStudio Server Again, you’re encouraged to use the Smith College RStudio Server. Log in using your Smith username and password (i.e., same as for your email, BannerWeb, etc.)\n Upload the RMarkdown File  Click Upload on Files tab in the section of the Bottom-Right quadrant of the RStudio interface\n Select the RMarkdown file from wherever you downloaded it onto your computer\n Once you click “ok” and the file uploads, the file will appear in a list of all files located in your personal storage on the server.\n   Open, edit (including putting in your answers), and knit the file  To open the file, just click on the file name in the Files tab. It will open in the top left quadrant  To edit the file  Change your name and the date on the file in the header at the top of the file\n Type in your answers under the prompts for each exercise section\n As shown in the gif below, the document will be easier to read if put your answers in with a blank line before and after, but don’t worry too much about that for right now.\n   Save the file to save your work.  You can also change the filename - to put your name in the filename, update a version number, etc. - with the File menu at the top left of the interface (File - \u0026gt; Save As). Just name it what you want, and add “.rmd” as the file extension. It’s good practice to rename files so as not to mistakenly overwrite older files, to make sure you upload the version of the file you intend to submit, etc.   Knit the file [see the bottom if you’re working locally, on your desktop version]  Click on the knit button/icon in the quandrant with your RMarkdown file. Knit runs the RMarkdown file and combines (or knits) the r code (we don’t have any yet, but you will) and text into the output format of your choice.\n RStudio will pop up a new window with your knitted, output file. (Note, if you have a pop-up blocker, you may not see the file immediately – click “Try Again” to open the file)\n    Export the file(s) from the server to your local computer.  Select the file(s) you want to download from the Files tab in the bottom right\n Select “More”, and then “export” to download the files from the server\n   Upload the file(s) to Moodle for the HW assignment of interest. You can click and drag files or select them from your documents.\n You’re done!  If you are using RStudio locally (i.e., on your computer) One challenge of working on your desktop - even potentially if you have used RStudio before! – is that you may need an additional piece of software to knit to a pdf. Specifically, RStudio uses TeX, an open source software program that takes markdown files like RMarkdown and can output them into a variety of formats, including Microsoft Word and .pdf. Download and install the version of TeX based on your operating system; if you were running RStudio, be sure to re-start it. Once TeX is installed, RStudio should immediately find the TeX program you installed and be able to knit to a pdf.\nSimplest: install the TinyTeX package\nMore Robust: Dowload and install the full TeX software\n Mac users: MacTeX http://tug.org/mactex/\n Windows users: MikTeX http://miktex.org/download\n  This software is already installed on the server, and you should have no trouble knitting to a pdf from the server. This is a big reason, especially early in the semester, why using the the server is much easier.\n  ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"7158a6e654285243f8c5c7924de1a024","permalink":"/resources/homework/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/homework/","section":"resources","summary":"Steps for Homework Sign into RStudio Server Upload the RMarkdown File Open, edit (including putting in your answers), and knit the file Export the file(s) from the server to your local computer.

How to work with an RMarkdown file? More detailed introduction  Troubleshooting RMarkdown Getting more help    Intro and Background Two videos made for a specific textbook and lab session that we won’t be using (some sections of introductory statistics and Intro to Data Science here at Smith have used this book). However, the general ideas remain applicable for our class.\nWhy RMarkdown? Take a look at this video that explains the principles of what a RMarkdown file does – and why it’s a powerful approach for combining statistical output and text to explain those results.\n   How to work with an RMarkdown file? A second video gets more into the mechanics of what goes into an RMarkdown file for our purposes. Ignore the parts about using a “template” – that’s one of the pieces that’s specific to this textbook and lab. Pay attention, instead, to the general ideas such: header information, code chunks, where R code and text each go within the document, and what it means to knit the file.\n   More detailed introduction  Roger Peng, a biostatistician at Johns Hopkins, data science faculty there, host of some statistics and data science podcasts, and pupeteer, has a helpful video to get started with a new RMarkdown file.      Troubleshooting RMarkdown You document won’t knit\nThere could be many reasons that cause a RMarkdown file not to be able to knit, so it’s hard in the abstract to give good advice. Usually, the error message will pinpoint the location of the problem. Read the error messages!!\nError messages typically include the line number of the issue of where the issue is. Go to that line of your code and see if something doesn’t look right.\nSome most common problems we see in this class include:\n having your data loaded in the environment, but not in your RMarkdown file. Remember, an RMd file has to be self-contained, meaning everything that it will need is included in the file itself.\n including output in your code chunks\n including the \u0026gt; or + prompts that come from the console in your code chunks,\n Not including all the packages you need for your code. This error will occur if you try to use a function in a package that you haven’t loaded previously in your Markdown document. ## Error in library(imadethisup): there is no package called 'imadethisup'\n There can be characters R doesn’t understand and cannot process. This most commonly happens when pasting text in from the pdf textbook, if you have a separate keyboard installed (for a different language), or you try to insert special characters, like greek symbols for an equation.\n As we get into the course, you may want to write out equations using the equation features in RMarkdown. These can get complicated – and thus, extremely error prone – very quickly. Most of the time you’re either missing a $ or need a space (or to remove a space) between the $ and the equation.\n  -No Knit HTML button: This means that RStudio doesn’t understand your document is supposed to be an RMarkdown document, often because your file extension is .txt. To fix this, go to the Files tab (lower right corner, same pane as Plots and Help) and select the checkbox next to your document’s name. Then select Rename and remove the .txt and make sure the extension is .Rmd.\nGetting more help When in doubt, consult the authoritative source. The R Markdown website contains a detailed tutorial with videos. There are also Cheatsheets available from within RStudio. Simply go to: Help -\u0026gt; Cheatsheets -\u0026gt; R Markdown Cheat Sheet for the most commonly used R Markdown commands.\n  ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"93d3dee82c0608e83ef9889677da0578","permalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/rmarkdown/","section":"resources","summary":"Intro and Background Why RMarkdown?

I will try to respond to all course-related messages within 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on the weekend (really). We all have full lives to balance with our work in this class - I am no exception - and our goal should be attentive and timely, but not immediate, exchanges.\n  Course Description In this course, students will learn how to use statistical models to analyze real-world data. Students will develop an understanding to how to choose the best regression model for a different types of response variables, include and transform different types of explanatory variables, and fit models with statistical software. This course will encourage and foster communication skills to convey results precisely and clearly to a general, non-technical audience.\nThe main goal of this course is to learn how to build statistical models - models that will let you understand and estimate the relationships between multiple phenomena, assess differences in an outcome of interest between multiple groups, and even make predictions. Our world is complicated, full of possible competing explanations for some apparent relationship. Multiple regression moves beyond many of the statistical tests and approaches from introductory statistics that consider simple differences between two variables (i.e., one response and one predictor variable, respecitvely). Instead, multiple regression offers one way to adjust statistically for myriad alternative explanations of the apparent relationship between the response and predictor; or to account statistically if the relationship between the response and predictor varies by other factors. With this course, you will develop useful quantitative modeling skills that allow you to harness data to enrich your understanding of the world we live in.\n  Course Objectives After completing this course, you will be able to choose different statstical modeling approaches (and understand their assumptions), be able to fit these models empirically using statistical software (R), assess how well the model you fit, and use that model to address your hypothesis, including to communicate what you found to a wide audience. Specifically, the course objectives are for you to:\n Master the 4-step process of choosing, fitting, assessing, and using statistical models Identify and fit models for quantitative and categorical responses, including effective use of transformations when conditions are not met Understand confounding conceptually, and successfully implement approaches to adjust for confounding and moderation/modification in statistical software Detect outliers and influential points in models Test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals for slopes of regression models Construct prediction intervals based on regression models Compare different regression models and identify the best model empirically Understand how multicolinearity and correlated predictors affect a model Use odds and odds ratios to understand categorical response variables    Prerequisites A college-level introductory statistics course (e.g. MTH/SDS/PSY 201, GOV 190/203, SOC 203, MTH 219, MTH/SDS 220, ECO 220), a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics Exam, or permission of the instructor. Students need to be familiar with basic statistical concepts including graphical and numerical descriptive statistics, the normal and \\(t\\)-distributions, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals.\n  Required Readings This course uses one textbook. This book is required and is available at the Grecourt bookstore in the basement of the Campus Center. In case you choose to acquire the book elsewhere, note that you will not need online access for the purposes of this course.\n Cannon, A.R., Cobb, G.W., Hartlaub, B.A.,… Whitmer, J.A. (2019). STAT2: Modeling with Regression and ANOVA (2nd Ed.). New York: W.H. Freeman.  The 1st edition from 2013 is now much cheaper and will work for probably 80% of what you’ll need; the remainder is new homework problems, improved descriptions, and a few additional chapters. You can access the data freely for the new homework problems and will just need to check in with a copy of the 2nd edition periodically. The library will have copies of the new edition on reserve, and I will try to highlight places of noticeable difference.\nAdditional recommended readings, such as applications of material covered in class in the news, will be available on the course website and via Slack.\n  Assignments I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, work hard in practice, try to learn stuff, work collaboratively, ask for lots of help, and don’t cheat. Don’t be that person.\nThe course assignments will include a homework assignment and quizes most weeks of the course, three individual, take home exams, and a group project with sections/drafts due throughout the course culminating in a final presentation and paper. The homework and the group project are the backbone of this course and must be completed satisfactorily to receive an A or B grade in the course.\nHomework Practice problems (mainly from the book) will be assigned (almost) every week on Monday in class and on Moodle; homework will be due via Moodle before 11:55AM of the following Monday. Homework should be completed in RMarkdown; both the RMarkdown and resulting knitted files should be submitted via Moodle. Homework will be graded, and you will be occasionally be asked to present your solution to a homework problem to the class. Late homeworks will have 25% off if submitted within 48 hours of the deadline and no points thereafter. Everyone has one free 48 hour extension that you may take whenever you need it. Please just let me know when you plan to take it.\n Group Project A significant, culminating activity for this class will be to conduct a statistical investigation on a question of interest to you. These projects will be done in groups of three of your choosing. You will use existing data - publicly and freely available data online, or from faculty research you may be involved in. The project will be broken into multiple component parts due throughout the semester, culminating in a 10 minute oral presenation (with slides) in the last week of class and a final written report due the last day of class. We will spend time in class discussing questions of a reasonable scope for this project, reviewing available data sources, and writing a proposal and resulting report.\n Take Home, Individual Exams There will be three, shorter take home exams throughout the semester. More details about the format and content of the projects will be available closer to the projects. I grant extensions only if your Class Dean is involved at least 24 hours before of the assignment deadline and suggests that flexibility with deadlines would be useful; exceptions to this rule for emergencies (i.e., hospitalizations) will be considered on a case by case basis. There will not be a final exam during finals period; your group project report will be due during that time.\n Quizzes There will be brief (\\(\\leq\\) 20 minutes) quizes on Moodle due every week on Monday before 11:55AM (to be precise). You will be able to repeat the quiz as many times as needed before Monday at 11:55AM. So, effectively, the grade is for completion of the quiz, since you can retake it. The goal of the quizzes is to give timely feedback on your understanding of the previous week’s material before the course moves on to new material. In rare cases, a quiz will also include questions about the assigned readings for the week ahead. Quizzes will be easy if you have been keeping up with the reading and the homework. The quiz contents will be discussed in Thursday’s class. There will be no make-up quizzes, but your lowest quiz score will be dropped. The quizes on Moodle will open Friday at noon (12:00pm) and close Monday before 11:55AM; you have 3 days to find 20 minutes to complete the quiz.\n Grading Policy Course grades will be a weighted average of the grades on your group project, take home inidividual projects, homework, and quizzes. A small amount of your grade for participation includes class attendance, participation in class activities and discussions, as well as professional conduct. Professional conduct expectations include: treating classmates, guest speakers, and instructors with respect; ensuring that all communication is done in a respectful and courteous manner - this includes email.\n 25% of your grade will be determined by a semester-long group project, including progress and success on small assignments throughout the semester, as well as a written paper and a poster presentation given at the end of the semester.\n 25% of your grade will be determined by weekly homeworks practicing implementation of concepts in R.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a first individual, take home exam on simple linear regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a second individual, take home exam on multiple linear regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a third individual, take home exam on logistic regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by in-class projects and reading responses.\n 5% of your grade will be determined by weekly Moodle quizzes\n 5% of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation. Generally, attend class, ask and answer questions in class and/or on Slack.\n  The purpose of grades is to provide formative feedback that aids your learning. I keep course grades in the online gradebook on Moodle so you can always check them there. But what matters is learning. I will enthusiastically talk to you about your learning anytime, and I encourage discussions in which we go over the work you have completed. These conversations let me hear about your challenges and questions, and provide important learning opportunities. However, my rule is that we shouldn’t talk (and especially haggle) about the points or letter grade assigned unless I have made a clerical error.\n   Resources Course Website Course information, including this syllabus, will be available on the course Moodle site. I will update information posted there regularly with class handouts, homework, project assignments, and announcements.\n Computing We will use the R statistical software package extensively and exclusively. R is open source software that is available for free on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. There is an extensive section of the course Moodle site with R resources, which may be espectially useful for those newer to R. There are two ways to access R for this class:\n Server: The Smith College server, which you are strongly encouraged to use. Enrolled students will get an account for the server shortly after the beginning of the class. The advantages of using the server version are that it is cloud based: your work will be automatically saved and backed up, and you can work from any computer that has an internet connection (note: you need to be on a Smith College IP address to access the server, to access it off-campus, you may need to establish a VPN connection to Smith). Like any shared resource, there are limits on how much data you can store (only really relevant for projects, not homeworks) and how quickly it processes during periods of high use.\n Desktop: You can also download R and RStudio to your computer and run things locally. Note - homework will be submitted via PDF, which requries additional software TeX. It seems like the best option our purposes is TinyTeX which you can install as you would other R packages – see more info on TinyTeX here.\n  Note that you do not have to choose one or the other; indeed, you can use both at different points in the class. For instance, you may want to get started using the server for homeworks and then transition to working on your project locally to maximize processing power and speed. Keeping your files on a cloud (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) in a folder shared among your group members will facilitate collaboration if you’re all working from your individual desktops.\n Student Hours I am available in my office Mondays 10:30AM-12:30pm, Wednesdays 9:30-11:00AM for students to stop by and discuss anything that relates to the course or would be helpful to talk about in person. These hours are a great opportunity to clarify issues that have come up in class and in homeworks (including R), to discuss research opportunities, your academic interests as they relate to SDS, talk about a news story you read that involved statistical modeling, even just to say hi. Some questions are easier to answer in person than via email, and many - myself included! - feel more comfortable asking questions one-on-one than in front of class. Student hours are a great option for both scenarios. Practically, the hours on Monday are a good opportunity to resolve questions that came up in the previous week’s class before the quiz or on the homeworks that are due most Mondays.\n Additional Support on Campus Stat TAs There are Stat TAs available from 7 to 9 pm on Sunday - Thursday evenings in McConnell 301. Each TA has a brief bio at the https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html. Most are familiar with the material covered in this course and all can provide support for working in R.\n Data Assistants \u0026amp; Data Research and Statistics Counselor Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning (now in Seelye 207) supports students doing quantitative work across the curriculum. The Center has a Statistics Counselor and Data Assistants available for appointments.\n Writing Support The Jacobson Center for Writing (Seelye 307) offers a variety of services design to help students improve writing skills, including drafts of their papers. This resource may be especially useful for the final project paper.\n    Course Policies Attendance Your attendance in class - including being on time - is crucial to your and your classmates’ success. We are all going to learn this material together, so we need to have everyone present and working. I will make accommodations for an unavoidable absence if you notify me in advance. Our Honor Code means that you will be the judge of whether or not an absence was unavoidable. (For instance, staying in bed because you had the flu would be an unavoidable absence, but oversleeping because you stayed up late to write a paper would be an avoidable absence.) One necessary absence during the semester is not unusual; having more than two is uncommon.\n Collaboration Much of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected encouraged and to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for course projects. However, every word that you write must be your own. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. All students are bound by the Smith College Honor Code.\n Written and Oral Communication Skills Your ability to communicate results, which may be technical in nature, to your audience, which is likely to be non-technical, is critical to your success as a data analyst. The homework and project assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing. In addition, there were will be many opportunities throughout the class where you will be asked to present your results from in class exercises, homeworks and the final project to your classmates. Consider this course as a way to develop these crucial communication skills and be quick to seek support from peers, in student hours, and from other resources (see above) as needed to do so.\n Email and Course Communications Student Hours and Slack will be the best way to reach me. I am actively on slack during the work day (9-5pm) and sometimes in the evenings. If you have questions about HW, please post them to the Slack channel for that assignment and answer other peoples’ questions if you know the answer! If you do get in touch via email, I will do my best to respond within 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on the weekend. It will be helpful if you include an informative subject line, including the course number (i.e., “SDS 291 HW 3 Question”).\n Timeliness, Deadlines, and Extensions Deadlines matter in this class, both because: a. these parameters help us keep our focus on the course content rather than logistics and b. because they matter in “the real world”. When assignments are due before 11:55am, Moodle counts submissions at 11:55:01am as late. This policy can be very challenging for people who put off their work until the last minute; I encourage you to start homework assignments early. Late work has 25% off if submitted within the first 48 hours after the deadline. I allow for one “free”, no-penalty 48 hour extension – this applies to homeworks. If you need another extension or a longer extension during the semester, I grant extensions only if your Class Dean is involved well in advance of the assignment deadline and suggests that flexibility with deadlines would be useful.\n Academic Honor Code The Smith College honor code articulates general expectations for students’ conduct throughout the course. While some specific applications of the honor code are noted throughout other sections of the syllabus, these examples are illustrative and not exhaustive. In accordance with the honor code statement below, suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information and honest and respectful use of college resources. Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. All submitted work of any kind must be the original work of the student who must cite all the sources used in its preparation.\n Again, every word that you write must be your own. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable, will receive no credit, and warrants notification of the Academic Honor Board. Similarly, Moodle quizes and take home exams should be completed independently and should not be discussed with other students during the open individual take home exam/quiz window. Per College policy, suspected violations will be reported to Academic Honor Board.\nWith this in mind, I note that many of the materials used in this course build substantially from previous course instructors’ work, namely Ben Baumer, Amelia McNamara, Miles Ott, as well as contributions and insights on this syllabus from Chad Topaz, Jude Higdon, and Steven Miller. I thank them for their work and willigness to share these materials.\n Course Accomodations If you have documented accomodations with Office of Disability Services, please share the letter from their office via email as soon as possible. This includes if changes to exisiting accomodations or any new accomodations emerge through the semester.\n Health and Well-Being Your well-being matters to me personally and as a course instructor vis-a-vis your success in this course. I encourage you to use your support resources (including those on campus, like your Class Dean, RA, and Health Services) early and often. If you have social, health, emotional or financial challenges that significantly affect your performance in the course, please feel free to email me and set up a time to talk.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Description  Course Objectives  Prerequisites  Required Readings  Assignments Homework Group Project Take Home, Individual Exams Quizzes Grading Policy   Resources Course Website Computing Student Hours Additional Support on Campus   Course Policies Attendance Collaboration Written and Oral Communication Skills Email and Course Communications Timeliness, Deadlines, and Extensions Academic Honor Code Course Accomodations Health and Well-Being    Instructor  Dr. Benjamin Capistrant  Lilly Hall 310  bcapistrant@smith.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
