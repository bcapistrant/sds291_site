At the beginning of every class, I will post a quiz on iCollege with the following questions:\nAre you here in class today?  Yes (3.5 points) No (0 points)  How much of today’s reading did you finish?  100% (6 points) 75–99% (5 points) 50–74% (4 points) 11–49% (2 points) 0–10% (0 points)  How well did you read?  I was engaged and read carefully (6 points) I was fairly engaged and read fairly carefully (4 points) I skimmed it (2 points) I didn’t read it at all (0 points)   Each day is worth 15.5 points. It is unlikely that you’ll score a 15.5 every day.3 Your total preparation score will naturally shift up at the end of the semester, though, since the preparation category is worth 210 points rather than 217 (15.5 × 14), so be honest—there’s wiggle room in the point system for honesty.\n Problem sets To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets.\nThere are 7 problem sets on the schedule. I will keep the highest grades for 6 of them. That is, I will drop the lowest score (even if it’s a zero). This means you can skip one of the problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (33 points (110%) in gradebook) Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔: (28 points (93%) in gradebook) Problem set is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (15 points (50%) in gradebook) Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.  You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than four people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.\nImportant points to consider for a complete assignment:\n answer in complete sentences use the conditions/terminology for scatterplots we talked about in class answer in the context of these data and the question (i.e., use the units, so that it’s easily interpretable)  For example: with the Porsche data, convert the miles back to 1000s, and the price into $; see p. 29 for a good interpretation of slope and intercept in the context of the problem  explain your rationale and evidence for why you think something is or isn’t true for subjective questions (e.g., 1.9c) state the null and alternative hypotheses for any statistical tests submit both .Rmd code and knitted PDF on Moodle Use the server to make your life easier with knitting to PDF Knit early so pesky errors don’t cause trouble just before the deadline   Evaluation assignments For your final project, you will conduct a pre-registered evaluation of a social program using synthetic data. To (1) give you practice with the principles of program evaluation, research design, measurement, and causal diagrams, and (2) help you with the foundation of your final project, you will complete a set of four evaluation-related assignments.\nIdeally these will become major sections of your final project. However, there is no requirement that the programs you use in these assignments must be the same as the final project. If, through these assignments, you discover that your initially chosen program is too simple, too complex, too boring, etc., you can change at any time.\nThese assignments will be graded using the same check system from the problem sets.\n Code-through The objectives of this class include “Become curious and confident in consuming and producing evaluations,” “Run statistical models,” and “Share your analyses and data with the public.” To help you with this, you will write a code-through tutorial of some program evaluation principle or approach.\nOne of the reasons R is so popular is because the R community is exceptionally generous and open and sharing.4 The internet is full of tutorials and code-throughs where people explain how to do something interesting with R.\nYou will write one code-through or tutorial during the semester on a of your choice (related to program evaluation and causal inference, of course). You will complete this on your own, but you can get help from your team (but you can’t all write about the same topic). You can find the instructions for the assignment here.\nThis assignment will be graded using the same check system from the problem sets.\n Exams There will be two exams covering (1) program evaluation, design, and causation, and (2) the core statistical tools of program evaluation and causal inference.\nYou will take these exams online through iCollege. The exams will be timed, but you can use notes and readings and the Google. You must take the exams on your own though, and not talk to anyone about them.5\nI will post examples of exam questions prior to the actual exams.\n Final project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of program evaluation and causal inference by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project are here.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\n  Take detailed notes, work through the example code and try to understand it, have vivid dreams about statistics, etc.↩\n Also (4) ask for help!↩\n But it would be amazing if you did!↩\n So are Python and other modern open source languages too.↩\n Again, be honest.↩\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1579940005,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Preparation Problem sets Evaluation assignments Code-through Exams Final project   Preparation You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage1 with the readings.2\nTo encourage attendance and preparation, I use an honor-system-based self-reporting system.

Some R developers have even started to adopt tutorial-focused approaches to development, where their code isn’t complete until they can easily teach it to others.\nThe code examples I include on each week’s class page and in the weekly RStudio.cloud projects are a good example of didactic tutorials. In addition, the R-Weekly e-mail newsletter includes dozens of these kinds of tutorials every week, and Mara Averick (chief tidyverse advocate at RStudio) regularly tweets out links to different posts as well. Here are some others examples to give you a jist of what you can do:2\n The Greatest Twitter Scheme of All Time? Mapping Fall Foliage with sf Exploring Minard’s 1812 plot with ggplot2 Animations in R Drone sightings in the US, visualized Quickly play with Polity IV and OECD data (and see the danger of US democracy)  You will complete this assignment on your own, but you can get help from others (but you can’t all write about the same topic).\nInstructions Here’s what you need to do:\nDecide what statistical or causal or program evaluation concept you want to demonstrate. Perhaps you want to show how DAGs are important and what you can do to control for back doors, or demonstrate how to run a regression discontinuity model, or how to make a plot that shows a program effect from a diff-in-diff model. This is entirely up to you!\n Write a tutorial that walks a reader through a demonstration of this concept. Your problem sets have been focused on a final product. In this assignment, here the focus is didactic. Show intermediate steps, explain why you do what you do, etc. The reader should learn something new from this tutorial.\nThere’s no word count here, but there should be several steps and examples of the concept you’re demonstrating.\nYou should write this in R Markdown, since that allows you to mix prose and code.\nYour demonstration must be reproducible. Use built-in datasets from the wooldridge package (like injury or jtrain2 or jtrain3 and so on), or use the wakefield package to simulate data, or point the reader to a CSV file from the internet and incorporate read_csv() into your code-through.\n Knit the final version of your tutorial as a PDF, Word file, or HTML file.\n Upload the knitted document to iCollege.\nIf you’re feeling especially brave, post the HTML version of your document to some public website (Medium, a personal blog, etc.), tell me, and I’ll promote it in the #rstats community on Twitter. You’ll probably get super rich and famous if you do this.\n  I will grade this using a check system.\n  So are Python and other modern open source languages too.↩\n Yours won’t be nearly as complicated as these, by the way.

We will not be using the RStudio Cloud exclusively, but we will need to use it at a least a few points during the semester. Join the course Slack and post an animal gif in the channel for your section (Section 01: 1:20-2:35, or Section 02: 2:45 - 4:00pm). If you’re new to Slack, look through the Resources section of this page for some more information to get started. Add a 1-2 songs to a playlist for our class. I like playing music at the beginning of class and during in-class work time (there will be a lot), so add something you’d like to hear. See more here about adding to a collaborative playlist. If you don’t have a Spotify account or have trouble adding songs directly to Spotify, just add the song title and artist in this google form.   Getting started with R \u0026amp; Refreshing Statistics New to R? Feeling rusty on your introductory statistics material?*\nDon’t fret – we’ll do this all together, no need to feel like you have to do any prep before class. If you want to practice R, especially during the first few weeks of semester when the workload is a little lighter, try the primers in RStudio Cloud, especially the first four (don’t worry about iterate or write functions) Take a look back at your intro stats text book, or this open source textbook. You might want to review normal distributions, tests of differences in means (t-tests), ANOVA, and interpretation of p-values and confidence intervals. We’ll cover the regression specific material, but those ideas underlie much of regression. Again, I wouldn’t stress about this at this point, but a very quick skim could help get the dust off your recall of this material.  *Many former students have had some anxiety coming into the class about the learning curve to learn R. I am fully anticipating – and can empathize with! – this nervousness. We will talk plenty about how to get going with R for those in the class who haven’t used it before, with additional resources as we get going. We’ll cover what you need in class, but if you want to do some extra practice in the first few weeks of the semester while things are (generally) quiet, it might be useful to do so.\n ","date":1580256000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580256000,"objectID":"37c0da0754749764020549dc227c4c5d","permalink":"/assignment/00-assign-getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/00-assign-getting-started/","section":"assignment","summary":"Initial Course Administration Tasks Getting started with R \u0026amp; Refreshing Statistics   Initial Course Administration Tasks There are a few small, administrative things to get started.

If you begin an intervention or launch a study prematurely, you can waste time and money—and potentially lives.\nEven if you have a well designed program with an impeccable logic model and a perfect DAG, you might discover (too late!) that you forgot to collect some critical variables or realize that your identification strategy will not work.\nFrom a more cynical perspective, you might (unethically) engage in the practice of p-hacking—running all sorts of different model specifications until you find the results you want, and then claim in your report that you had intended to run that model all along.\nOne increasingly popular method for (1) ensuring that your data and methods work before launching a study or intervention, and (2) declaring and committing to your hypotheses and methods and models before analyzing your data is to pre-register your research or evaluation. A pre-registered study contains all the background work—an introduction, literature review, theory, hypotheses, and proposed analysis—but without the actual data. Authors post their expectations and hypotheses publicly so they can be held publicly accountable for any deviations from their proposed design.1\nThe best preregistered studies use simulated data that has the same structure as the data that will be collected (i.e. same columns, sometimes the same correlations and relationships researchers expect to see in the collected data, etc.). Because there’s no data yet (or just fake data), you have more freedom when developing a preregistered study. You can experiment with different models, play with different approaches, manipulate data in different ways, and so on. If you realize that you need a new variable, or that you need to rearrange questions on a survey, or make any other kinds of changes, you can—you haven’t collected the data yet!\nOnce you finalize your plan and know all the data you need to collect, and once you’ve written out the different models you’ll run, all you have to do is collect the real data, plop it into your script (replacing the fake data you’d been using), and run the analysis script again to generate the actual, real results. In the results section, you get to either say “As predicted, we found…”, or “Contrary to expectations, we found that…”.\nFor your final project in this class, you will write a pre-registered analysis of a public or nonprofit social program that you’re interested in. You don’t need to worry about collecting data—you’ll create a synthetic dataset for your pre-analysis.\nYou will submit three things via iCollege:\nA PDF of your preregistered report (see the outline below for details of what this needs to contain). You should compile this with R Markdown. You might want to write the prose-heavy sections in a word processor like Word or Google Docs and copy/paste the text into your R Markdown document, since RStudio doesn’t have a nice spell checker or grammar checker. This should have no visible R code, warnings, or messages in it (set echo=FALSE at the beginning of your document before you knit). The same PDF as above, but with all the R code in it (set echo=TRUE at the beginning of your document and reknit the file). A CSV file of your fake data.  This project is due by 7:00 PM on Wednesday, April 29, 2020. No late work will be accepted.\nYou can either run the analysis in RStudio locally on your computer (highly recommended(!!), since you won’t have to worry about keeping all your work on RStudio’s servers), or use an RStudio.cloud project. You can make a copy of this RStudio.cloud project—it doesn’t have anything in it, but I have preinstalled all the packages we’ve used over the course of the semester, so you don’t have to.\n  Empty RStudio.cloud project  Empty RStudio project you can download and unzip on your computer (doesn’t include any packages, since you’re responsible for installing those)  Resources Most importantly, do not hesitate to work with classmates. You all must choose different programs, but you can work in groups of up to 4 people on your own projects. Also, absolutely do not hesitate to ask me questions! I’m here to help!\nYou might find this evaluation (and its proposal) of a truancy program in the Provo School District in Utah helpful as an example for the first half of this assignment (program overview, theory, implementation, threats to validity, and outcomes). The PSD evaluation doesn’t have DAGs or fancy econometrics models like RCTs, diff-in-diff, RDD, IVs, or anything like that, so you can’t use it as an example of that part, but these should provide a good template for the program-specific sections. This is longer than expected for this class. I provide suggested word counts in the outline below.\n  psd-proposal-2011  psd-final-report-2012   Suggested outline Here’s an outline of what you’ll need to do.2 You can download this as an RMarkdown file and change the text if you want. I’ve also included this as an RMarkdown file in the empty RStudio.cloud project.\n  final-project-template.Rmd  Introduction Describe the motivation for this evaluation, briefly describe the program to be evaluated, and explain why it matters for society. (≈150 words)\n Program overview Provide in-depth background about the program. Include details about (1) when it was started, (2) why it was started, (3) what it was designed to address in society. If the program hasn’t started yet, explain why it’s under consideration. (≈300 words)\n Program theory and implementation Program theory and impact theory graph Explain and explore the program’s underlying theory. Sometimes programs will explain why they exist in a mission statement, but often they don’t and you have to infer the theory from what the program looks like when implemented. What did the program designers plan on occurring? Was this theory based on existing research? If so, cite it. (≈300 words)\nInclude a simple impact theory graph showing the program’s basic activities and outcomes. Recall from class and your reading that this is focused primarily on the theory and mechanisms, not on the implementation of the program.\n Logic model Describe the program’s inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. Pay careful attention to how they are linked—remember that every input needs to flow into an activity and every output must flow out of an activity. (≈150 words)\nUse flowchart software to connect the inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes and create a complete logic model. Include this as a figure.\n  Outcome and causation Main outcome Select one of the program’s outcomes to evaluate. Explain why you’ve chosen this (is it the most important? easiest to measure? has the greatest impact on society?) (≈50 words)\n Measurement Using the concept of the “ladder of abstraction” that we discussed in class (e.g. identifying a witch, measuring poverty, etc.), make a list of all the possible attributes of the outcome. Narrow this list down to 3-4 key attributes. Discuss how you decided to narrow the concepts and justify why you think these attributes capture the outcome. Then, for each of these attributes, answer these questions:\n Measurable definition: How would you specifically define this attribute? (i.e. if the attribute is “reduced crime”, define it as “The percent change in crime in a specific neighborhood during a certain time frame” or something similar) Ideal measurement: How would you measure this attribute in an ideal world? Feasible measurement: How would you measure this given reality and given limitations in budget, time, etc.? Measurement of program effect: How would to connect this measure to people in the program? How would you check to see if the program itself had an effect?  (≈150 words in this section)\n Causal theory Given your measurement approach, describe and draw a causal diagram (DAG) that shows how your program causes the outcome. Note that this is not the same thing as the logic model—you’ll likely have nodes in the DAG that aren’t related to the program at all (like socioeconomic status, gender, experience, or other factors). The logic model provides the framework for the actual implementation of your program and connects all the moving parts to the outcomes. The DAG is how you can prove causation with statistical approaches. (≈150 words)\n Hypotheses Make predictions of your program’s effect. Declare what you think will happen. (≈50 words)\n  Data and methods Identification strategy How will you measure the actual program effect? Will you rely on an RCT? Differences-in-differences? Regression discontinuity? Instrumental variables? How does your approach account for selection bias and endogeneity? How does your approach isolate the causal effect of the program on the outcome?\nAlso briefly describe what kinds of threats to internal and external validity you face in your study.\n(≈300 words)\n Data Given your measurement approach, limits on feasibility, and identification strategy, describe the data you will use. Will you rely on administrative data collected by a government agency or nonprofit? Will you collect your own data? If so, what variables will you measure, and how? Will you conduct a survey or rely on outside observers or do something else? What does this data look like? What variables does it (or should it) include?\n(≈100 words)\n  Synthetic analysis Generate a synthetic (fake) dataset in R with all the variables you’ll need for the real life analysis. Analyze the data using your identification strategy. For instance:\n If you’re relying on observational data, close all the backdoors, don’t adjust for colliders, and make a strong argument for isolation of the causal effect in the absence of treatment/control groups If you’re doing an RCT, test the differences in means in the treatment and control groups (and follow all other best practices listed in the World Bank book, checking for balance across groups, etc.) If you’re doing diff-in-diff, run a regression model with an interaction term to show the diff-in-diff If you’re doing regression discontinuity, check for a jump in the outcome variable at the cutoff in the running variable If you’re using instrumental variables, check the validity of your instrument and run a 2SLS model  Include robustness checks to ensure the validity of your effect (i.e. if you’re doing regression discontinuity, test different bandwidths and kernel types; etc.)\n(As many words as you need to fully describe your analysis and results)\n Conclusion What would the findings from this analysis mean for your selected program? What would it mean if you found an effect? What would it mean if you didn’t find an effect? Why does any of this matter? (≈75 words)\n   See the Center for Open Science’s directory of preregistrations, or AsPredicted list for examples of this in real life.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-3.5.1.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 3.6.1) and download it.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n Select the installer that corresponds with your computer’s operating system (Windows or macOS):\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse2 for instance, consists of dozens of packages that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n   It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n A universe of packages centered around tidy data, including ggplot2↩︎\n   ","date":1576540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579940005,"objectID":"32d2aa5db9c906dd4dae32456ff00876","permalink":"/reference/install/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/reference/install/","section":"reference","summary":"RStudio.cloud RStudio on your computer  Install R Install RStudio Install tidyverse    You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

and how they target specific parts of a logic model …the difference between identifying correlation (math) and identifying correlation (philosophy and theory) …what it means for a relationship to be causal   Regression and inference You should understand…\n …the difference between correlation coefficients and regression coefficients …the difference between outcome/response/dependent and explanatory/predictor/independent variables …the two purposes of regression …what each of the components in a regression equation stand for, in both “flavors” of notation:  \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\epsilon\\) for the statistical flavor \\(y = \\alpha + \\beta x_1 + \\gamma x_2 + \\epsilon\\) for the econometrics flavor  …how sliders and switches work as metaphors for regression coefficients …what it means to hold variables constant (or to control for variables) …the different elements of the grammar of graphics and be able to identify how variables are encoded in a graph (i.e. how columns in a dataset can be represented through x/y coordinates, through color, through size, through fill, etc.)  You should be able to…\n …write and interpret R code that calculates summary statistics for groups (i.e. group_by() %\u0026gt;% summarize()) …write and interpret R code that builds linear models (i.e. lm()) …interpret regression coefficients …interpret other regression diagnostics like \\(R^2\\) …use the %\u0026gt;% pipe in R to chain functions together …use ggplot() to visualize data  Helpful resources:\n  Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, R for Data Science  Kieran Healy, “How ggplot works,” chapter 3 in Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction   Theories of change and measurement You should understand…\n …how to describe a program’s theory of change …the difference between inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes …the elements of a program’s impact theory: causes (activities) linked to effects (outcomes) …the elements of a program’s logic model: the explicit links between all its inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes …the difference between implicit and articulated program theories …the purpose of smaller-scale mechanism testing …how indicators can be measured at different levels of abstraction …what makes an indicator a good indicator  You should be able to…\n …identify a program’s underlying theory based on its mission statement …draw a program impact theory chart that links activities to outcomes …draw a program logic model that links inputs to activities to outputs to outcomes …identify the most central elements of a potential outcome measurement   Counterfactuals and DAGs You should understand…\n …how a causal model encodes our understanding of a causal process …how to identify front door and back door paths between treatment/exposure and outcome …why we avoid closing front door paths …why we close back door paths …why adjusting for colliders can distort causal effects …the difference between logic models and DAGs …the difference between individual level causal effects, average treatment effects (ATE), conditional average treatment effect (CATE), average treatment on the treated effects (ATT), and average treatment on the untreated (ATU) …what the fundamental problem of causal inference is and how we can attempt to address it  You should be able to…\n …draw a possible DAG for a given causal relationship …identify all pathways between treatment/exposure and outcome …identify which nodes in the DAG need to be adjusted for (or closed) …identify colliders (which should not be adjusted for)  Helpful resources:\n  Malcom Barrett, “An Introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs”  Malcom Barrett, “An Introduction to ggdag”  Judea Pearl, “A Crash Course in Good and Bad Control”: A quick summary of back doors, front doors, confounders, colliders, and when to control/not control for DAG nodes  Causal Inference Bootcamp, “Average Treatment Effects,” Duke University  Causal Inference Bootcamp, “Unit Level Effects,” Duke University  Causal Inference Bootcamp, “Conditional Average Treatment Effects,” Duke University  Causal Inference Bootcamp, “Counterfactuals,” Duke University  Neel Ocean, “Understanding Selection Bias”: explanation of how to identify selection bias from the ATT and the ATE, with an explanation of how ATE = ATT + selection bias under the potential outcomes framework  Paul Hünermund, “Sample Selection vs. Selection Into Treatment”   Threats to validity You should understand…\n …what it means when a study has internal validity and know how to identify the major threats to internal validity, including: omitted variable bias (selection and attrition), trend issues (maturation, secular trends, seasonality, testing, regression to the mean), study calibration issues (measurement error, time frame of study), and contamination issues (Hawthorne effects, John Henry effects, spillovers, and intervening events) …why selection bias is the most pernicious and difficult threat to internal validity and how we can account for it …what it means when a study has external validity …what it means when the measures used in a study have construct validity …what it means when the analysis used in a study has statistical conclusion validity  You should be able to…\n …identify existing and potential threats to validity in a study …suggest ways of addressing these threats  Helpful resources:\n Really, just google “threats to internal validity” or “threats to external validity” and you’ll find a billion different slide decks, articles, and lessons about these. They’re a pretty standard part of any research design class.

I will try to respond to all course-related messages within 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on the weekend (really). We all have full lives to balance with our work in this class - I am no exception - and our goal should be attentive and timely, but not immediate, exchanges.\n  Course Description In this course, students will learn how to use statistical models to analyze real-world data. Students will develop an understanding to how to choose the best regression model for a different types of response variables, include and transform different types of explanatory variables, and fit models with statistical software. This course will encourage and foster communication skills to convey results precisely and clearly to a general, non-technical audience.\nThe main goal of this course is to learn how to build statistical models - models that will let you understand and estimate the relationships between multiple phenomena, assess differences in an outcome of interest between multiple groups, and even make predictions. Our world is complicated, full of possible competing explanations for some apparent relationship. Multiple regression moves beyond many of the statistical tests and approaches from introductory statistics that consider simple differences between two variables (i.e., one response and one predictor variable, respecitvely). Instead, multiple regression offers one way to adjust statistically for myriad alternative explanations of the apparent relationship between the response and predictor; or to account statistically if the relationship between the response and predictor varies by other factors. With this course, you will develop useful quantitative modeling skills that allow you to harness data to enrich your understanding of the world we live in.\n  Course Objectives After completing this course, you will be able to choose different statstical modeling approaches (and understand their assumptions), be able to fit these models empirically using statistical software (R), assess how well the model you fit, and use that model to address your hypothesis, including to communicate what you found to a wide audience. Specifically, the course objectives are for you to:\n Master the 4-step process of choosing, fitting, assessing, and using statistical models Identify and fit models for quantitative and categorical responses, including effective use of transformations when conditions are not met Understand confounding conceptually, and successfully implement approaches to adjust for confounding and moderation/modification in statistical software Detect outliers and influential points in models Test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals for slopes of regression models Construct prediction intervals based on regression models Compare different regression models and identify the best model empirically Understand how multicolinearity and correlated predictors affect a model Use odds and odds ratios to understand categorical response variables    Prerequisites A college-level introductory statistics course (e.g. MTH/SDS/PSY 201, GOV 190/203, SOC 203, MTH 219, MTH/SDS 220, ECO 220), a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Statistics Exam, or permission of the instructor. Students need to be familiar with basic statistical concepts including graphical and numerical descriptive statistics, the normal and \\(t\\)-distributions, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals.\n  Required Readings This course uses one textbook. This book is required and is available at the Grecourt bookstore in the basement of the Campus Center. In case you choose to acquire the book elsewhere, note that you will not need online access for the purposes of this course.\n Cannon, A.R., Cobb, G.W., Hartlaub, B.A.,… Whitmer, J.A. (2019). STAT2: Modeling with Regression and ANOVA (2nd Ed.). New York: W.H. Freeman.  The 1st edition from 2013 is now much cheaper and will work for probably 80% of what you’ll need; the remainder is new homework problems, improved descriptions, and a few additional chapters. You can access the data freely for the new homework problems and will just need to check in with a copy of the 2nd edition periodically. The library will have copies of the new edition on reserve, and I will try to highlight places of noticeable difference.\nAdditional recommended readings, such as applications of material covered in class in the news, will be available on the course website and via Slack.\n  Assignments I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, work hard in practice, try to learn stuff, work collaboratively, ask for lots of help, and don’t cheat. Don’t be that person.\nThe course assignments will include a homework assignment and quizes most weeks of the course, two exams, and a group project with sections/drafts due throughout the course culminating in a final presentation and paper. The homework and the project are the backbone of this course and must be completed satisfactorily to receive an A or B grade in the course.\nHomework Practice problems (mainly from the book) will be assigned (almost) every week on Monday in class and on Moodle; homework will be due via Moodle before 11:55AM of the following Monday. Homework should be completed in RMarkdown; both the RMarkdown and resulting knitted files should be submitted via Moodle. Homework will be graded, and you will be occasionally be asked to present your solution to a homework problem to the class. Late homeworks will have 25% off if submitted within 48 hours of the deadline and no points thereafter. Everyone has one free 48 hour extension that you may take whenever you need it. Please just let me know when you plan to take it.\n Final Project A significant, culminating activity for this class will be to conduct a statistical investigation on a question of interest to you. These projects will be done in groups of three of your choosing. You will use existing data - publicly and freely available data online, or from faculty research you may be involved in. The project will be broken into multiple component parts due throughout the semester, culminating in a 10 minute oral presenation (with slides) in the last week of class and a final written report due the last day of class. We will spend time in class discussing questions of a reasonable scope for this project, reviewing available data sources, and writing a proposal and resulting report.\n Tests There will be three in-class tests throughout the semester. More details about the format and content of the exams will be available closer to the exam. There will not be a final exam during finals period; your project report will be due during that time.\n Quizzes There will be brief (\\(\\leq\\) 20 minutes) quizes on Moodle due every week on Monday before 11:55AM (to be precise). You will be able to repeat the quiz as many times as needed before Monday at 11:55AM. So, effectively, the grade is for completion of the quiz, since you can retake it. The goal of the quizzes is to give timely feedback on your understanding of the previous week’s material before the course moves on to new material. In rare cases, a quiz will also include questions about the assigned readings for the week ahead. Quizzes will be easy if you have been keeping up with the reading and the homework. The quiz contents will be discussed in Thursday’s class. There will be no make-up quizzes, but your lowest quiz score will be dropped. The quizes on Moodle will open Friday at noon (12:00pm) and close Monday before 11:55AM; you have 3 days to find 20 minutes to complete the quiz.\n Grading Policy Course grades will be a weighted average of the grades on your project, tests, homework, and quizzes. A small amount of your grade for participation includes class attendance, participation in class activities and discussions, as well as professional conduct. Professional conduct expectations include: treating classmates, guest speakers, and instructors with respect; ensuring that all communication is done in a respectful and courteous manner - this includes email.\n 25% of your grade will be determined by a semester-long group project, including progress and success on small assignments throughout the semester, as well as a written paper and a poster presentation given at the end of the semester.\n 25% of your grade will be determined by weekly homeworks practicing implementation of concepts in R.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a first test on simple linear regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a second test on multiple linear regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by a third test on logistic regression.\n 10% of your grade will be determined by in-class projects and reading responses.\n 5% of your grade will be determined by weekly Moodle quizzes\n 5% of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation. Generally, attend class, ask and answer questions in class and/or on Slack.\n  The purpose of grades is to provide formative feedback that aids your learning. I keep course grades in the online gradebook on Moodle so you can always check them there. But what matters is learning. I will enthusiastically talk to you about your learning anytime, and I encourage discussions in which we go over the work you have completed. These conversations let me hear about your challenges and questions, and provide important learning opportunities. However, my rule is that we shouldn’t talk (and especially haggle) about the points or letter grade assigned unless I have made a clerical error.\n   Resources Course Website Course information, including this syllabus, will be available on the course Moodle site. I will update information posted there regularly with class handouts, homework, project assignments, and announcements.\n Computing We will use the R statistical software package extensively and exclusively. R is open source software that is available for free on Mac, Windows, and Linux operating systems. There is an extensive section of the course Moodle site with R resources, which may be espectially useful for those newer to R. There are two ways to access R for this class:\n Server: The Smith College server, which you are strongly encouraged to use. Enrolled students will get an account for the server shortly after the beginning of the class. The advantages of using the server version are that it is cloud based: your work will be automatically saved and backed up, and you can work from any computer that has an internet connection (note: you need to be on a Smith College IP address to access the server, to access it off-campus, you may need to establish a VPN connection to Smith). Like any shared resource, there are limits on how much data you can store (only really relevant for projects, not homeworks) and how quickly it processes during periods of high use.\n Desktop: You can also download R and RStudio to your computer and run things locally. Note - homework will be submitted via PDF, which requries additional software TeX. For Mac users, I recommend MacTeX, and for Windows users, I recommend MiKTeX((https://www.latex-project.org/get/](here)).\n  Note that you do not have to choose one or the other; indeed, you can use both at different points in the class. For instance, you may want to get started using the server for homeworks and then transition to working on your project locally to maximize processing power and speed. Keeping your files on a cloud (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) in a folder shared among your group members will facilitate collaboration if you’re all working from your individual desktops.\n Student Hours I am available in my office Mondays 11:00AM-12:30pm, Wednesdays 9:00-10:00AM for students to stop by and discuss anything that relates to the course or would be helpful to talk about in person. These hours are a great opportunity to clarify issues that have come up in class and in homeworks (including R), to discuss research opportunities, your academic interests as they relate to SDS, talk about a news story you read that involved statistical modeling, even just to say hi. Some questions are easier to answer in person than via email, and many - myself included! - feel more comfortable asking questions one-on-one than in front of class. Student hours are a great option for both scenarios. Practically, the hours on Monday are a good opportunity to resolve questions that came up in the previous week’s class before the quiz or on the homeworks that are due most Mondays.\n Additional Support on Campus Stat TAs There are Stat TAs available from 7 to 9 pm on Sunday - Thursday evenings in McConnell 301. Each TA has a brief bio at the https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html. Most are familiar with the material covered in this course and all can provide support for working in R.\n Data Assistants \u0026amp; Data Research and Statistics Counselor Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning (now in Seelye 207) supports students doing quantitative work across the curriculum. The Center has a Statistics Counselor and Data Assistants available for appointments.\n Writing Support The Jacobson Center for Writing (Seelye 307) offers a variety of services design to help students improve writing skills, including drafts of their papers. This resource may be especially useful for the final project paper.\n    Course Policies Attendance Your attendance in class - including being on time - is crucial to your and your classmates’ success. We are all going to learn this material together, so we need to have everyone present and working. I will make accommodations for an unavoidable absence if you notify me in advance. Our Honor Code means that you will be the judge of whether or not an absence was unavoidable. (For instance, staying in bed because you had the flu would be an unavoidable absence, but oversleeping because you stayed up late to write a paper would be an avoidable absence.) One necessary absence during the semester is not unusual; having more than two is uncommon.\n Collaboration Much of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected encouraged and to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. All students are bound by the Smith College Honor Code.\n Written and Oral Communication Skills Your ability to communicate results, which may be technical in nature, to your audience, which is likely to be non-technical, is critical to your success as a data analyst. The homework and project assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing. In addition, there were will be many opportunities throughout the class where you will be asked to present your results from in class exercises, homeworks and the final project to your classmates. Consider this course as a way to develop these crucial communication skills and be quick to seek support from peers, in office hours, and from other resources (see above) as needed to do so.\n Email and Course Communications Student Hours and Slack will be the best way to reach me. I am actively on slack during the work day (9-5pm) and sometimes in the evenings. If you have questions about HW, please post them to the Slack channel for that assignment and answer other peoples’ questions if you know the answer! If you do get in touch via email, I will do my best to respond within 24 hours during the week and 48 hours on the weekend. It will be helpful if you include an informative subject line, including the course number (i.e., “SDS 291 HW 3 Question”).\n Timeliness, Deadlines, and Extensions Deadlines matter in this class, both because: a. these parameters help us keep our focus on the course content rather than logistics and b. because they matter in “the real world”. When assignments are due before 11:55am, Moodle counts submissions at 11:55:01am as late. This policy can be very challenging for people who put off their work until the last minute; I encourage you to start homework assignments early. Late work has 25% off if submitted within the first 48 hours after the deadline. I allow for one “free”, no-penalty 48 hour extension. If you need another extension or a longer extension during the semester, I grant extensions only if your Class Dean is involved well in advance of the assignment deadline and suggests that flexibility with deadlines would be useful.\n Academic Honor Code The Smith College honor code articulates general expectations for students’ conduct throughout the course. While some specific applications of the honor code are noted throughout other sections of the syllabus, these examples are illustrative and not exhaustive. In accordance with the honor code statement below, suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information and honest and respectful use of college resources. Smith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. All submitted work of any kind must be the original work of the student who must cite all the sources used in its preparation.\n Again, every word that you write must be your own. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of R code from another student is not acceptable, will receive no credit, and warrants notification of the Academic Honor Board. Similarly, Moodle quizes and take-home projects should be completed independently and should not be discussed with other students during the open exam/quiz window. Per College policy, suspected violations will be reported to Academic Honor Board.\nWith this in mind, I note that many of the materials used in this course build substantially from previous course instructors’ work, namely Ben Baumer, Amelia McNamara, Miles Ott, as well as contributions and insights on this syllabus from Chad Topaz, Jude Higdon, and Steven Miller. I thank them for their work and willigness to share these materials.\n Course Accomodations If you have documented accomodations with Office of Disability Services, please share the letter from their office via email as soon as possible. This includes if changes to exisiting accomodations or any new accomodations emerge through the semester.\n Health and Well-Being Your well-being matters to me personally and as a course instructor vis-a-vis your success in this course. I encourage you to use your support resources (including those on campus, like your Class Dean, RA, and Health Services) early and often. If you have social, health, emotional or financial challenges that significantly affect your performance in the course, please feel free to email me and set up a time to talk.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579984979,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Description  Course Objectives  Prerequisites  Required Readings  Assignments Homework Final Project Tests Quizzes Grading Policy   Resources Course Website Computing Student Hours Additional Support on Campus   Course Policies Attendance Collaboration Written and Oral Communication Skills Email and Course Communications Timeliness, Deadlines, and Extensions Academic Honor Code Course Accomodations Health and Well-Being    Instructor  Dr. Benjamin Capistrant  Lilly Hall 310  bcapistrant@smith.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
