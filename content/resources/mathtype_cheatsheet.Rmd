Let's get familiar with how you might write the regression equation we're about to fit in R. We need to know a little bit of different notation for equations.

* `$`: begin and end the equation. 
* `$$`: before and after the equation put the equation in the center of a new line
* `\`: precedes any symbol, accent, operator, or other non-text item
* `_`: subscript
* `^`: superscript
* `{}`: any text that gets an accent (e.g., see *hat*) or to denote explicitly a word after a subscript/superscript
* `\beta`: $\beta$
* `\epsilon`: $\epsilon$
* `\cdot`: $\cdot$ (e.g., `\cdot Mileage` is $\cdot Mileage$)
* `\bar{}`: $\bar{y}$
* `\hat{}`: $\hat{y}$ (e.g., `\hat{\beta}` is $\hat{\beta}$ )
* `\widehat{}`: $\widehat{}$ (e.g., `\widehat{SmithCollege}` is $\widehat{SmithCollege}$)


Some other features that may be useful in the course:

* `\ne`: $\ne$ or not-equal-to
* `\pm`: $\pm$ or plus-or-minus 
* `\frac{}{}`: a fraction, where the numerator is in the first set of brackets and the denominator is in the other
* `\sqrt{}`: $\sqrt{}$ square root


Examples:

- `$H_0: \beta_1 \ne 0$` is $H_0: \beta_1 \ne 0$.
- `$y = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Mileage+\epsilon$` results in $y = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Mileage+\epsilon$.
- `$y = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Mileage+\epsilon$` results in $y = \beta_0+\beta_1 \cdot Mileage+\epsilon$.

- `$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot Mileage$$` results in 
$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0+\hat{\beta}_1 \cdot Mileage$$
