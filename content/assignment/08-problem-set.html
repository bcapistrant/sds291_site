<h1>Clarifications and Cautions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to use <code>SexCode</code>, not <code>Sex</code> so that the direction of the associations are consistent with others from the class – makes working together easier – and to facilitate some od the subsequent question and calculations. [Note, you can get the exact same thing from using <code>Sex</code> so long as you define the reference group the same way <code>SexCode</code> is coded – that 1 is females and 0/reference for males – so that the regression coefficients calculate the same thing. If you want extra practice, try both!]</li>
