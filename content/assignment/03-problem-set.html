<h2>Additional Question:</h2>
<p>We’re using the same data as from class this week: a sample of 104 homes in Northampton, MA to see whether being close to the bike trail enhances the value of the home. Specifically, we’re looking at the association between square feet (a house’s size) and distance from the rail trail with the house’s estimated value in 2014. The variables we’re using are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Price2014</code>: Zillow price estimate from 2014 (in thousands of dollars)</li>
<li><code>Distance</code>: Distance (in <em>miles</em>) to the nearest entry point to the rail trail network</li>
<li><code>Bedrooms</code>: Number of bedrooms</li>
</ul>
