## Problem sets / Homework

To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets. 

There will be 9 problem sets on the schedule: 5 before Spring Break and 4 after. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system, which will hold numeric grade corrolaries.

- ✔+: Problem set is 100% completed and correct. The document is organized, clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. _(Corresponds to an A)_
- ✔:  Problem set is 85–99% complete and most answers are correct. **This is the expected level of performance.** _(Corresponds to an A-)_
- ✔−: Problem set is less than 85% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often. _(Corresponds to a B)_

You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but *you must turn in your own answers.* You cannot work in groups of more than **four** people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.


## Take Home Exams 

There will be two take home exams - one on simple linear regression and one on logistic regression. The planned exam for multiple linear regression was cancelled.
