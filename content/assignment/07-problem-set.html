# Clarifications &amp; Cautions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>9.18 or 9.28: don’t calculate the OR here – that comes later. For “a”, you can use conditional proptortions or percentages - of females, what % survived - but don’t do more than that here (calculating the OR comes in 9.19/9.29c). And for “b”, just talk about the direction of the slope and how it corresponds to “a”.</p></li>
<li><p>9.19/9.29c: it refers to “an estimated coefficient from the output for the model found in (b)” – that should be “in 9.18/9.28b” <em>not</em> 9.19/9.29b.</p></li>
