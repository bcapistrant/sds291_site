# Required

- Nothing :)

# Strongly Recommended

- Do the extra practice of Likelihood from Class on Wednesday (and check your own answers against the solutions from the RMD)
- 11.7, 11.9 (check your answers with the back of the book)

# Only if you *really* want the extra practice

- 10.21, 10.22 (2nd Ed or see below)

```{r}

```

- 10.19 (1st Ed) / 10.31 (2nd Ed). If you didn't do this last week, try it now. If you *did* do it already, reconsider the question in light of the revisiting of likelihoods, *G* statistic, and drop-in-deviance test. Try it again and/or reflect on what the similarities and differences are in these approaches.  See the [ChiSquare test handout](http://sds291.netlify.app/20/ChiSq.pdf) (or [RMD](http://sds291.netlify.app/20/ChiSq.rmd)) for more reference.


# Don't Submit on Moodle

There is nothing you need to submit, everything is optional and to be done if you want.  I'd encourage you to talk amongst yourselves on Slack about any of the extra practice problems as a way of checking answers.
