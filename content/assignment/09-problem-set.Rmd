# Required

- Nothing :)

# Strongly Recommended

- Do the extra practice of Likelihood from Class on Wednesday (and check your own answers against the solutions from the RMD)
- 11.7, 11.9 (check your answers with the back of the book)

# Only if you *really* want the extra practice

- 10.21, 10.22 (2nd Ed or see below)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("http://sds291.netlify.app/HW/HW9_ExtraQs.JPG")
```

- 10.19 (1st Ed) / 10.31 (2nd Ed)*

* If you didn't do this last week, try it now. If you *did* do it already, reconsider the question in light of the revisiting of likelihoods, *G* statistic, and drop-in-deviance test. Try it again and/or reflect on what the similarities and differences are in these approaches.  See the [ChiSquare test handout](http://sds291.netlify.app/20/ChiSq.pdf) (or [RMD](http://sds291.netlify.app/20/ChiSq.rmd)) for more reference.
