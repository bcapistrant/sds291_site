<h2>Problem sets / Homework</h2>
<p>To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets.</p>
<p>There will be 9 problem sets on the schedule: 5 before Spring Break and 4 after. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system, which will hold numeric grade corrolaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: Problem set is 100% completed and correct. The document is organized, clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. <em>(Corresponds to an A)</em></li>
<li>✔: Problem set is 85–99% complete and most answers are correct. <strong>This is the expected level of performance.</strong> <em>(Corresponds to an A-)</em></li>
<li>✔−: Problem set is less than 85% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often. <em>(Corresponds to a B)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but <em>you must turn in your own answers.</em> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>four</strong> people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.</p>
