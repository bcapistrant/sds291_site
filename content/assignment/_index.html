<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets.</p>
<p>There are 7 problem sets on the schedule. <strong>I will keep the highest grades for 6 of them.</strong> That is, I will drop the lowest score (even if it’s a zero). This means you can skip one of the problem sets. You need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system, which will hold numeric grade corrolaries.</p>
<ul>
<li>✔+: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.</li>
<li>✔: Problem set is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. <strong>This is the expected level of performance.</strong></li>
<li>✔−: Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but <em>you must turn in your own answers.</em> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>four</strong> people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.</p>

<div id="take-home-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Take Home Projects</h2>
<p>There will be three take home projects - one on simple linear regression, one on multiple linear regression, and one on logistic regression.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project" class="section level2">
<h2>Final project</h2>
<p>At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of program evaluation and causal inference by completing a final project.</p>
<p>Complete details for the final project will be available soon.</p>
<p>There is no final exam. This project is your final exam.</p>
