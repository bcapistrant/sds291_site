<h2>1. Log Transformations</h2>
<p>Estimate the relationship between Number of Hospitals and Doctors within a sample of counties in the dataset called <code>CountyHealth</code>. (This dataset is from the <code>Stat2Data</code> package, just like other problems from the book and you can bring it in like the code we’ve used in class or on previous homework problems (e.g., “Cereal”, or “Perch”))</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Make a scatterplot of the relationship between <code>MDs</code> as the response and <code>Hospitals</code> as the explanatory variable and comment on what you see.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a new variable of the log of MDs and make a scatterplot of the relationship between logged version of <code>MDs</code> and Hospitals.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit the regression model of the relationship of the logged version of MDs and Hospitals and interpret the slope in a sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the regression model from “c” to predict the number of doctors (not log(MDs)) for 4 counties: one with 2,3,9, and 10 hospitals, respectively. Comment on how the difference in predicted number of doctors between the counties with 2 &amp; 3 and 9 &amp; 10 hospitals values corresponds to the regression slope from “c”.</p></li>

<h2>2. Odds, Probabilities, and Odds Ratios</h2>
<p>Below are data from an Intensive Care Unit <code>ICU</code>, on whether someone Survived (Yes/No) and their age group (Youngest: &lt;50yo, Middle: 50-69, Oldest: 70+).</p>

<li><p>Calculate the odds of surviving in the ICU for those in the youngest, middle, and oldest age groups. Interpret the odds of survival for the oldest group in a sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>From the odds in “a”, calculate the probability of survival for each age group. Interpret the probability of survival for the youngest group in a sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>From the table above, calculate the <em>proportion</em> of the youngest group who survived and compare this answer to your answer in “b”.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate a ratio of the odds of survival between those who are Middle vs. Youngest, and a ratio for those Oldest vs. Middle Aged. (No need to interpret, just calculate).</p></li>

<h1>Lightly Recommended</h1>
<p>These should be considered only for those who want a lot more practice with these ideas and to deepen your understanding beyond what we will need for this class.</p>
<p>Q1e. Does this model actually fit the data well? Try other transformations - of Hospitals, MDs, or both - until you find an arrangement that looks reasonable for a linear regression model; report the results of that model and explain why you think it might be best.</p>
<p>Q2e. Calculate the 95% Confidence Intervals for the Odds Ratios.</p>
<p>Q3.
a. Use the Guan paper to calculate the OR and 95% CI for Diabetes and the “Primary Endpoint” (ICU admission, intubation, or death.)</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Use <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6913e2.htm">this paper</a> out this Tuesday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to calculate the OR and 95% CI for diabetes and ICU admissions (ICU vs. non-ICU) in the U.S.</p></li>
<li><p>Are the OR and the 95% CIs in “a” and “b” similar? How do they compare?</p></li>
<li><p>What does this tell you about how diabetes is associated with COVID progression in the US compared to China? What <em>doesn’t</em> it tell you, and what else would you want to know?</p></li>
