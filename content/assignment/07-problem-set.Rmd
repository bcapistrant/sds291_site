# Clarifications and Cautions

- 9.18 or 9.28: don't calculate the OR here -- that comes later. For "a", you can use conditional proptortions or percentages - of females, what % survived - but don't do more than that here (calculating the OR comes in 9.19/9.29c). And for "b", just talk about the direction of the slope and how it corresponds to "a".

- 9.19/9.29c: it refers to "an estimated coefficient from the output for the model found in (b)" -- that should be "in 9.18/9.28b" _not_ 9.19/9.29b.

There are multiple Titanic datasets that exist in different R packages, so be sure that you're drawing on the one from Stat2Data package (it is `Titanic` with a capital "T").

Yes, [this Titanic](https://www.theguardian.com/news/1912/apr/16/leadersandreply.mainsection).

Or, if you want, this one.
