<h1>IPUMS: Integrated Public Use Micro-data System</h1>
<p>IPUMS is a database / repository that we will be using for the group projects in class. You may only work with IPUMS data, which sounds like a constraint, but is actually a great opportunity to work with relatively clean, well-documented data that could include any number of possible topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ipums.org/whatIsIPUMS.shtml">What is IPUMS?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context. Data and services available free of charge.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IPUMS has created the world’s largest accessible database of census microdata. IPUMS includes almost a billion records from U.S. censuses from 1790 to the present and over a billion records from the international censuses of over 100 countries. We have also harmonized survey data with over 30,000 integrated variables and 150 million records, including the Current Population Survey, the American Community Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, the Demographic and Health Surveys, and an expanding collection of labor force, health, and education surveys. In total, IPUMS currently disseminates integrated microdata describing 1.4 billion individuals drawn from over 750 censuses and surveys.</p>

<div id="why-are-we-using-ipums-for-this-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Why are we using IPUMS for this class?</h3>
<p>The IPUMS user interface, data documentation, and having already “cleaned” much of the data will make your life substantially easier. Specifically, it will give you only the data you choose/need and remarkably better documented than many other sources of data you might find elsewhere. The benefit here is that you can focus instead on the actual task for this project - using your regression modeling skills you’re developing in the class - rather than wrangling unnecessary data. Given the breadth of the surveys / datasources included under the IPUMS umbrella, IPUMS should also serve a wide range of interests, especially economics, health, and social sciences. With 750 censuses/surveys, everyone in our class should be able to find a topic of interest from the IPUMS data. Last (but certainly not least), they have a R package called <code>ipumsr</code> (package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr">here</a> and vignettes <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/vignettes/ipums.html">here</a>) to help import their data into R.</p>

<h3>IPUMS Data Sources &amp; How they’re used in the News</h3>
<p>Some of the bigger surveys that IPUMS has worked to integrate over time get cited frequently in the press and used by other analysts, like Nathan Yau in his <a href="blog">Flowing Data</a>. Although most of these examples aren’t of regression modeling per se, they should give a sense of some of the flavor for what data each survey has and the kinds of questions you can answer with each of the surveys. For more academic applications of these data, you could also see <a href="https://www.ipums.org/awardwinners.shtml">IPUMS research award winners</a> for some inspiration.</p>
<div id="current-population-survey-cps" class="section level4">
<h4>Current Population Survey (CPS)</h4>
<p>IPUMS CPS harmonizes microdata from the monthly U.S. labor force survey, the Current Population Survey (CPS), covering the period 1962 to the present. Data include demographic information, rich employment data, program participation and supplemental data on topics such as fertility, tobacco use, volunteer activities, voter registration, computer and internet use, food security, and more.</p>
