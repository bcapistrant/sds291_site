You'll need to find a group of 3 (you and 2 others) to work together throughout the semester on a project with a topic of your choosing.

When you have your group, please come up with a group name.

Then, fill out [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3Wu2dsmn-8OYaWon88ApV9OHBXjyTxg2JTWUTNreAWO-ZFQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) with your group name and members.
