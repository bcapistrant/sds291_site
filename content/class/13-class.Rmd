## In-class Activity

- [Activity](http://sds291.netlify.com/mlr/mlr_inclass_2020_v00.html)

- [Activity Answers](http://sds291.netlify.com/mlr/mlr_inclass_2020_answers_v00.html) (and raw [`.rmd` file](http://sds291.netlify.com/mlr/mlr_inclass_2020_answers_v00.rmd))

You need to have gotten through the bringing in and cleaning up the data by the end of Day 1.  We will extend this on Day 2 with regression modeling.

### Submit to Moodle
There is no template for this activity. You're a pro at making your own RMarkdown files now!

You are expected to knit to pdf and to submit your rmd as well (just like a homework). Please submit 1 .rmd and 1 .pdf per group.

Use the Day 13 submission on Moodle for [section 1](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=36873) or [section 2](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=36874).
