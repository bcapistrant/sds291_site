# Who & What

Emma Livingston, a Senior SDS major, will be leading another workshop on using `dplyr` - part of the tidyverse packages we have been using - for data management, such making new variables, renaming and/or recoding variables.

# When & Where

- McConnell 103
- Friday, 3/27 from 2-4pm

# Goals for the Session are to:

- Practice Creating New Variables with `mutate()`
- Learn how to select variables (`select()`) and keep rows (`filter()`)
- Renaming variables and recoding values

# What you will need for the session

- A computer that can run RStudio

# Do I *Have* to Attend? Do I *Have* to Use GitHub?

No and No. This is gently encouraged, especially if you haven't taken SDS 192: Intro to Data Science, but definitely optional.
