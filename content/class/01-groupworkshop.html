<div id="do-i-have-to-attend-do-i-have-to-use-github" class="section level1">
<h1>Do I <em>Have</em> to Attend? Do I <em>Have</em> to Use GitHub?</h1>
<p>No and No. This is gently encouraged, especially if you’re considering an SDS major, but definitely optional.</p>
<p>There are many other – often simpler – ways to collaborate. You could have your data on a shared GoogleDrive, all install FileStream and work from there.</p>
<p>GitHub is useful for more advanced ways of resolving collaboration issues like having two conflicting versions of the same R code.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking of an SDS major, this might be good to try out; if you’re not, feel free to skip it. There will be subsequent workshops that will be more applicable to everyone who is working in R, like data management and data visualization.</p>
