# Who & What

Emma Livingston, a Senior SDS major, will be leading a final workshop, this time on using `ggplot` - part of the tidyverse packages we have been using - for data visualization, particularly visualizing regression results.

# When & Where

# Goals for the Session are to:

TBD

# What you will need for the session

- A computer that can run RStudio

# Do I *Have* to Attend? Do I *Have* to Use GitHub?

No and No. This is gently encouraged, especially if you haven't taken SDS 192: Intro to Data Science, but definitely optional.
