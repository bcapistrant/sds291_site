## In-class Activity

- Original `.Rmd` file we worked with in class is [here](http://sds291.netlify.com/02/02_Activity.Rmd) 

- Version after class with completed answers [as a knitted .pdf](http://sds291.netlify.com/02/02_Activity_afterClass.pdf) (and [raw .Rmd](http://sds291.netlify.com/02/02_Activity_afterClass.Rmd))

## Additional support and resources

- Similar to what we did today, check out a few videos in the [Resources](http://sds291.netlify.com/resources/) section that introduce RMarkdown and go through replicating the material in Chapter 1.1 to Chapter 1.3 of the textbook.
