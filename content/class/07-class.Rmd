## In-class Activity

- [Slides](http://sds291.netlify.com/07/07_Lecture_Slides.html)

- [Google Doc for Taking Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jduEDFO4oYwXkDHHg3q9zJQBnIVzlaaXrdFbd2kzIEA/edit?usp=sharing). This is "view only" -- make a copy for yourself and note away!

- Extra Practice with 2D & 3D: the [lab exercise](http://sds291.netlify.com/07/AccordPrice3DPractice.html) and [raw `.rmd` file](http://sds291.netlify.com/07/AccordPrice3DPractice.rmd) (Note: to run this .rmd file, you'll need the `rgl` package, which isn't included on the server -- effectively, you can only re-run this `.rmd` with a *desktop* version of R/RStudio)
