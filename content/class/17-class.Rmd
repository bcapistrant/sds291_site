## In Class Materials

- [Slides](https://sds291.netlify.com/17/17-class-lectureslides.html) ([`.rmd` raw file](https://sds291.netlify.com/17/17-class-lectureslides.rmd))

- Practice 
    - Below is the same document in different formats. PDF is easier for a tablet, pen/paper, or to use the "annotate" drawing features, and google doc is easier if you're more comfortable with that approach or want to share with classmates and work together. I will post the raw file and solutions later this week - the goal is to work on this first.
    - `.PDF` [version](https://sds291.netlify.com/17/17-class-exercise.pdf)
    - Google Doc [version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdE_KCEtbo_9iHUbJ3IyHMMxyrFhbgDkVj0VYKnwUcA/edit?usp=sharing) (now view-only, just make a copy)
