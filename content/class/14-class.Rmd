## Preparing for non-face-to-face instruction

Please fill out [this brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_w69VFlYvefJunY_gphM61hHoGnfOs5Wks8YMWEMymSnewg/viewform?usp=sf_link) so that I can understand what capacity you will have when we shift to remote instruction, what ideas you have to make this go most smoothly, and concerns you have and want to raise.

We will also talk some of this through in class together.

## In-class Activity

- [Activity](http://sds291.netlify.com/mlr/mlr_inclass_2020_v00.html)

Use your RMD from Day 1, and extend it on with regression modeling.

### Submit to Moodle
There is no template for this activity. You're a pro at making your own RMarkdown files now!

You are expected to knit to pdf and to submit your rmd as well (just like a homework). Please submit 1 .rmd and 1 .pdf per group.

Use the Day 14 submission on Moodle for [section 1](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=36873) or [section 2](https://moodle.smith.edu/course/view.php?id=36874).
